<H4>What is Firebird Project ?</H4>
Firebird is a commercially independent project of developers, technical advisors and supporters formed 30th, July 2000, after the release of InterBase® source code by Borland. The whole story of the project's evolution and events that precedes its foundation is documented in the <A href="index.php?op=history">History pages</A>.
<H4>What's project mission ?</H4>
Our project's primary goal is to enhance and further develop the <A href="index.php?op=guide&amp;id=rdbms">Firebird Relational Database Engine</A>, but our efforts quickly expanded into closely related areas like documentation for end users and developers, testing, connectivity options like JDBC and ODBC drivers, and management tools.
<H4>Who's behind Firebird ?</H4>
The Firebird project has currently (January, 2002) around 60 active members. Of course, that doesn't mean that there are 60+ developers working on the code of Firebird engine, as these people volunteer for various task surrounding the core development, like documentation, building, testing and packaging on various platforms, mentor and technical advisory, web site maintenance etc. Many members are dedicated to a particular sub-project, like ongoing development of a type 4 JDBC driver, or to particular problem area. The Firebird Team consists of many skilled and enthusiastic members including primary Interbase developers, former Interbase engineers, experienced Interbase users, and complete newcomers keen to lend a hand in any way they can.  This diverse, multi-talented, and ever-growing community is our greatest asset -- one that guarantees a very healthy future for the Firebird Project.
