2. Installing
-------------

0. Unpack txtforum-xxx.zip somewhere
1. Upload files to PHP 4.2+ powered webserver
2. CHMOD data directory (default "./tf.data/") 777
3. Go to forum.php, create admin account and define categorie(s).
4. That's all!

You can dowload additional templates for txtforum from 
<a href="http://zone.ee/txtforum/download-addons.php">zone.ee/txtforum/download-addons.php</a> and language-files from 
<a href="http://zone.ee/txtforum/download-addons.php#lang">zone.ee/txtforum/download-addons.php#lang</a>

* You can change filepermissions (CHMOD) with ftp-client (usually right 
mouseclick on file/directory and from menu choose CHMOD) or with Internet
Explorer (type in location bar ftp://ftpuser:password@yourserver.net right 
click on file / directory and from menu choose Properties and mark all 
checkboxes (its permissions 777) or only reading/writing one's (666).






3. Upgrading
============

If You have used txtForum 0.6.x then there are feature to upgrade 0.6.x 
postings to 0.7.x format. Simply login as administrator, go to 
Administrator Panel and choose Upgrade. Then You should choose category, 
where postings copy and click Submit. This copyes postings and users data 
over.

4. Tips
=======

* If forum dosen't works correctly, then maybe its caused thats 
  register_globals = off in server configuarion (php.ini). To fix this and put 
  it work, open tf.actions.php and almost in beginning of file is such line:

	#register_globals();

  remove '#' mark at the beginning of line and forum should work again!

* Does your server support GetImageSize() function for remote files?
  If supports, then you should change 'get_img_size' to true in tf.conf.php,
  so users can choose avatars from own homepages for example. Default value
  is false and users can choose avatars from local avatars directory 
  (./tf.img/avatars/ -- of course, there You may add more avatars).

* When You add or modify category there are options to set that only 
  registrered users can read or post new messages. There are more one option
  were only Admin can start new thread in some category.

* Is possible to add new moderator: login as administrator and goto memberslist
  (forum.php?action=members), choose user and select usergroup from listbox.

* If You wish to add into some other page of Your webpage subjects of last 
  topics from forum then add theses lines to Your page:

	&lt;?php
		include('tf.func.php');
		print last_postings(10);
	?&gt;

* There are function for repairing damaged categories file - Admin Control 
  Panel -> Categories settings -> Repair Categories File (this removes 
  unnecessaries lines and calculates correct postings/topics number).

* There are much options which to change in tf.conf.php (file paths,
  sessions expiry, avatar img types & max sizes, how many topics 
  showed per page etc).

* If You wish to add smileys then simply copy they in to ./tf.img/smileys
  directory. Forum finds they automatically.

* Default values for user statuses (depending posted messages) are only available
  in english (because isn't possible to use variables in array...). But You may
  change/translate they: open tf.conf.php and almost in end of file is multidimension
  array "$poster_status", which contains postings intervals and statuses. You may
  even add or remove elements (forum finds they automatically).

* If you wish to modify default smileys then open tf.conf.php and seek for
  '$static_smileys'. This is array which contains emoticons ";-)" with they 
  image equivalents ("wink.gif" for example). Of course, you may simply copy
  theses images over with same name from ./tf.img/smileys directory.

* If You wish to add topic icons then simply copy they in to ./tf.img/topic_icons
  directory. Forum finds they automatically.

* Forum compares unregistrered user browser default language with available langfiles
  in ./tf.lang/ directory and if browser default language = any available langfile
  then loads first one. If you don't want this comparing change 
  check_default_language = false in tf.conf.php.

* For info about templates see ./tf.doc/<a href="template_howto.txt">template_howto.txt</a>

* File ./tf.doc/<a href="tech.doc.txt">tech.doc.txt</a> contains info about all 
  txtForum files (usersdata, postings, headers etc) formats.
