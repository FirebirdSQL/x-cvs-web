$question = "Will you make new versions of Firebird ?" ;

$answer = "<blockquote>Certainly.  Firebird 1 had two major point releases following its initial release in March, 2002.  Firebird 1.5 - with the codebase entirely rewritten in C++, went into beta in January, 2003, with hopes for a full release before mid-year.  Firebird 2, which will have a new on-disk structure, is taking shape. </blockquote>";
