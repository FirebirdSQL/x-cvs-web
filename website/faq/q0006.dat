$answer = "
<blockquote>
The Documentation team is developing completely new documentation 
for Firebird.  It is an enormous job that, like any open source project, will never 
really be \"finished\".  It will just build up gradually and be kept up to date as 
new features get added to Firebird.  
<p>To examine what is already done, follow the 
\"Documentation\" links in the menu above.<p>
Treat the Firebird Release Notes as an important, cumulative part of your essential documentation.  We will continue to distribute these detailed, user-level notes until the full fabric of the new manuals is established. Look for the English versions in your Firebird kits. 
Translations and older versions can be downloaded from the Main Downloads pages at the 
IBPhoenix website, e.g. go to <a href=\"http://www.ibphoenix.com/main.nfs?a=ibphoenix&page=ibp_download_15\">this page</a> 
for the Firebird 1.5.x notes.
