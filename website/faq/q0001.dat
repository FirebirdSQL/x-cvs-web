<blockquote>
No, it's a &quot;feature&quot; of WinXP called DHCP Media Sense, that automatically disables the TCP/IP stack whenever there is no network connection. Switching it off requires adding a key to the Windows Registry.<p>
Open the Registry Editor and locate the folder HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters<br>
Add a new DWORD key named DisableDHCPMediaSense with a value of 1.  To re-enable Media Sense, change 
the value to 0.
