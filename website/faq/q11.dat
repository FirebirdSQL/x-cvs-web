<?php$question = "What will be in the release version of Firebird - I mean FB Server, FB Client, FB IntraClient, Components(FBX), FB Documentation, ODBC, Replicator, FB Console?" ;$answer = "<blockquote>The Server and the Client are not separate products:  they are built at the same time.There's no "IBClient product" as such.  The client component is just thelibrary that surfaces the Application Programming Interface function structures to a client application, allowing it to connect to and communicate with the server.<br>Firebird has left InterClient and Interserver alone, because the amount of effort required to get it working and up to date with latest standards just wasn't considered worth it.  Instead, a Client-Java project branch formed and has spent two years developing a totally new JDBC Type 4 driver.  The driver is named JBird - pronounced &quot;Jaybird&quot;.<br>Borland still markets its commercial InterClient 2 products.<br>There's no such thing as FBX. Borland still develops and markets the IBX components for its InterBase products and some versions are available free from their CodeCentral repository.  They are not willing to accept code patches to provide compatibility with bug fixes and new features in Firebird.  IBX policy for future support of Firebird is in Borland's hands. <br>If you need a moreserious alternative, consider FibPlus or IBObjects, which both support Firebird.<br>Unfortunately, free, integrated user documentation for Firebird is likely to be a long time coming.  We just don't have enough volunteers with time to do it.  The IBPhoenix company has a Publications arm that is generating Firebird manuals, which it distributes via its CD.  To date, IBP has produced a User Manual (Using Firebird) and a technical Reference Guide.  We understand an API manual is under way.  IBP also has a Firebird Quick Start Guide which is free to download. <br>There are several ODBC drivers available.  You can read about them on the Downloads>Contributed page of the IBPhoenix website.  The XTG driver and the Firebird ODBC/JDBC driver, also known as the Starkey driver, are both free and open source and can connect to both FB and IB.  They are independent of the core engine. Volunteers to tackle them are welcome.  The Gemini and Easysoft drivers are commercial but not very expensive. (Claudio Valderrama and Helen Borrie, Firebird members)</blockquote>";?>
