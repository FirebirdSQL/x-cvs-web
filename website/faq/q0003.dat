$question = "If I try to do some kinds of metadata changes when 
there is more than one connection to the database, I get the SQLCODE error 
 -607, \"unsuccessful metadata update-object COMPANY is in use\". Is 
exclusive access needed to change metadata?

" ;

$answer = "
<blockquote>
Only one client can be attached to a database at the time a
foreign key is declared.  Other metadata operations do not
have the same restriction.  This \"feature\" is as designed. 
When a foreign key is declared, all users of the database
must immediately respect the declaration.  In Firebird
Classic, that means all processes must be notified.  When
Foreign Keys were introduced, no mechanism was provided for
that notification, so the easiest route was to require
single-user access when declaring a new foreign key
constraint.
