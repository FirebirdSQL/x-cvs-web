<blockquote>
We are not planning on giving away the binaries, the source on Source Forge is a work in progress...We
are in business to make money. The source code is there for you to compile
and use in accordance with the IPL. We are not currently going to build it
for you.  (Jon Arthur, IB Product Manager, Borland SC)<p>
[The answer should be] No, we don't have a open source &quot;stable&quot; binary for download. The open source tree is our work bench...Yes [it's a use-at-your-own-risk product].  We don't run QA tests on the open source.  (Aaron Ruddick, Borland/IB QA)
