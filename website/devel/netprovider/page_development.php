You will need a recent snapshot of <a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net">nant 0.85</a>.
The nant build file is located in <i>builds\win32\ado.net</i>, there are a <i>build.bat</i> file
that can be used to build the sources if nant is in the PATH.
The default target frameworks in the nant build file are:
<ul>
    <li>Microsoft .NET 1.0</li>
    <li>Microsoft .NET 1.1</li>
    <li>Microsoft .NET 2.0</li>
    <li>Mono 1.0</li>
</ul>
The build will be done for all the framework versions that are installed and detected by nant.
If you want to build the Nunit test suite you will need to install <a href="http://nunit.sourceforge.net">NUnit 2.2</a>
</p>

<h3>Building the sources on Linux</h3>
<p>
You will need a working installation of <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a>.
There provider sources ships with a makefile to build the sources on linux that is located 
in <i>builds/linux<i>.
