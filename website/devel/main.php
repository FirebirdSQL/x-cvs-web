<H4>Welcome to Firebird's Forge !</H4>
This site area is devoted to Firebird development efforts, and you are at the right place if you are interested to learn more about our current developments, future plans or organization structure.</p>
<p>
Hosting for the Firebird project website and other web-based facilities are provided by Broadview Software, of Toronto, Canada.  Broadview is also a major cash sponsor of the Firebird Foundation, the sole source of funding for Firebird development.</p>
<blockquote>
If you have any interest in the viability of the Firebird Project then you should be giving serious consideration to contributing:
<ul>
  <li>If you, or your staff, have technical skills and time to contribute then join the firebird-devel list, our developers' laboratory, and make yourself known</li><br>
  <li>Even if you have no time or skills to offer, you can translate your gratitude for the benefits you or your company gains from having Firebird available by becoming a member or sponsor in the <a href="index.php?op=ffoundation">Firebird Foundation</a>.<br><br>The need for Firebird users to &quot;do the right thing&quot; is getting urgent.</li>
</ul>
