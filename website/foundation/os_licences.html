New code modules cannot be released under the InterBase Public Licence, that applies to modules inherited from Borland/Inprise, because of the licence's requirement to leave this declaration unchanged: "The Original Code was created by Inprise Corporation
 and its predecessors."<p>
For new modules being committed to the Firebird CVS tree or included in a custom code modules with a permitted distribution, we need to decide on a compatible licence under which to release these sources and include the appropriate notice (or "Exhibit") at the head of source files.  The choice of licence needs quite urgent discussion by Firebird admins and all active committers.
<p>
The following exhibits are for licences compatible with the IPL.  We will add more on request.
