<dt><b>Presidents Report (or The view from Philip Island)</b><p>

<dd>
Topic for this month: <b>The Annual General Meeting (AGM)</b>
<p>
Now it's already been a year since the foundation was officially formed (yep, time goes quickly).  So this month we've got an important procedural topic to discuss, the foundation's upcoming second Annual General Meeting.  The first AGM was held a year ago, with just 12 tired steering members present, who at that stage, just wanted to get on with Christmas - so it was fairly brief :-)
<p>
The committee has settled on opening the second AGM on February 3, 2004 and running it until to February 19, if necessary.  It will be an important meeting and election, since it will be the first one involving members who joined the Foundation since incorporation last November.
<p>
The "venue" for the AGM will the FFMembers list.  More details about the process used for our online meetings will become available prior to that date.  However, we urge all members to set aside some time during that period, to read, contribute and participate in the proceedings.
<p>

Now the AGM has <b>two main objectives</b>:
<ol>
<li>to elect those who will be responsible for running the foundation for the next year 
<p>
<li> to vote on issues, that require a vote by all (voting) members (e.g. changing the foundation constitution).
</ol>

I'll discuss each of these in a bit more detail below.
<p>
1) <u>Electing the Committee</u>
<br>
The foundation's day-to-day activities are run by "the committee", made up of a public officer, president, vice president, treasurer, secretary and other committee members.  These (new) officers and committee members begin their term of office when they are elected at the AGM and will be responsible for running the foundation for the next year.  As a committee member, you must be able to commit a reasonable amount of time to participate in the on-line committee meetings, which occur every two months, and to other tasks that you undertake.
<p>
Any voting member can nominate another voting member for one of these positions, (and yes you can nominate yourself - please do!). A seconder is also required for each nomination.  
<blockquote>
The membership type of every member is available on the <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org/ff/foundation/index.php?id=members.html"> Membership Register</a>.
<br>Details of the officers and the rules of the foundation are <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org/ff/foundation/index.php?id=rules.html">HERE</a>.
</blockquote>

<p>
Any voting member interested in nominating yourself, or others, please write a short resume about the person you wish to nominate, and send it to the Members list (ffmembers_at_lists.firebirdsql.org) for discussion. To help the process, the list of candidates and their resumes will be placed on a web page.  We look forward to a new year with a committee of inspired new and returning members.
<blockquote>
If you are not a voting member, but wish to be available for nomination, you may upgrade your membership.  Email the secretary helebor_at_tpg.com.au to arrange this.
</blockquote>


2) <u>Constitutional issues</u>
<br>
The AGM is the venue for considering items, such as changes to the constitution, that require a vote from all members.  Any voting member can propose a constitutional change for discussion. A proposal should have a one line title, and a paragraph or two of detailed description. Proposals also need to be nominated and seconded before they are accepted as an agenda item for the AGM.
<p>
If you plan to submit a proposal, you should start a discussion about the idea and the wording in the FFMembers list ahead of the time the AGM starts. After some discussion, formulate your proposal - preferably with a Seconder - and email it to the Secretary before the AGM begins.  
<p>
We will keep a web page of AGM proposals to coordinate the issues that pertain to the AGM.
<blockquote>
<u>Non-constitutional issues</u>
<br>
Please bear in mind that items which don't affect the foundation's policies or constitution are better resolved by discussing them in the ordinary business of the list, not as AGM issues.  You can pass proposals on non-constitutional issues through to the committee at any time.  
</blockquote> <p>
<b>January Committee meeting</b>
<br>
In order for members to see what the current committee has been doing and how it does it, we will hold the January 2004 committee meeting, starting around January 1, in the FFMembers list.  This will give everyone some idea, prior to the AGM, of how the online meetings are conducted and let everyone see what they are in for if they wish to nominate for the new committee :-).
<p>
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the current committee members, who have, in my opinion, done a superb job helping get the foundation started and in keeping it running over the last year.

<dt><b>Report from the committee meeting</b>
<dd>
We discuss a lot during the committee meetings--our November meeting contained around 400 posts. Amongst other things, we discussed registration of the Firebird brand and use of our name, grants, website, renewal of subscriptions, a factsheet about Firebird, QA, the "stopping a running query" project and our upcoming AGM. <br>The January committee meeting will be held in the ffmembers forum.
<p>
<dt><b>Future plans</b><p>
<dd>
Firebird 1.5 is continually getting closer to release and everybody is encouraged to celebrate that event! Merging the Firebird and Yaffil source code is also something to look forward to.
