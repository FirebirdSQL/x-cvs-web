Like probably many of you, before this Mozilla's hoop-la ambushed us last week, I never thought seriously about Firebird's name as a real business asset. It has different, deeper, emotional meaning for me.<p> And until this, I never realized how much I'm bound to it (and probably many others as well). The "storm" we provided for Mozilla crew to taste last days makes me wonder whether we shouldn't do something about proactively protecting it. If we are really so proud of Firebird that we're not willing to  give it up, we should probably build on that fact, and put more meaning in it. 

It's evident that there is a strong identity associated with Firebird's name for many users and developers, and that this identity is for many also commercially important (and rising). Although we see Firebird as a brand, our branding efforts were almost accidental till now, a side effect of our successful development and other activities. 

I think that we should learn from this case with Mozilla. It would probably have been prevented if we had really focused before on strengthening the <i>brand image</i>. They just simply don't recognize Firebird as important enough to consider the need to regard collision as an ethical problem, or strong enough to prosecute a law suit. They have blundered on both counts, as Firebird is important for a great many and we have the strength, even though we have a distaste for being forced to exert it.
<p>
Well, we were not in the best position to build a strong brand, but it's changing every day. We're now much bigger and stronger. We have 1.5 RC1, three years of existence, our own dedicated international conference, many dedicated websites around the world, whole companies that more or less depend on our work, the Foundation, books, etc. We're in very different situation than a year  or even six months back. So I think that time has come to push forward seriously with our Firebird branding efforts.
<p>
Of course, this should be planned first, but I think that it's right time to discuss it and actually begin seriously to DO something about it.
<p>
As a first thing, I think that we should claim "Firebird" as our trademark in public, and start to use the (tm) mark where appropriate. We can even file for registration in US (see below) to get the right to use (R) instead of (tm), and to avoid such hoop-la in future.
