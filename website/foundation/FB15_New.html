This is an overview of some of the most important changes in Version 1.5 against the 1.0 release of Firebird. It is assumed that you are familiar with Firebird 1.0. The complete list of changes and enhancements is long.  Here are just some of the highlights. For the full story, please refer to the Release Notes for Firebird 1.5 (in six languages, <a href="http://www.ibphoenix.com/main.nfs?a=ibphoenix&page=ibp_download_15">PDF files HERE</a>). </b>

        </tr>
      </table>

This release was built from code ported from the 
original C to C++, a process that begun back in 2000. 
Extensive code cleanup and bug­fixing has continued, 
along with new memory management and language 
enhancements.

          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

During the v.1.5 development process, the SQL query 
optimizer has undergone several enhancements and 
fixes, resulting in reported speed improvement of 
30 to 60 percent and more.

          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

Two significant new additions for Windows platforms 
are Classic server and Embedded server. 
There has not been a Classic server on Windows 
for nearly eight years. This one can utilize multiple 
processors, something which still eludes the Windows 
SuperServer. Though usable, Classic on Windows 
should be regarded as experimental. 
Embedded server is a dll that merges a single client 
attachment with a Firebird SuperServer for building 
very quick and efficient stand­alone and briefcase 
applications.

          <td valign=middle><h2>New language features</h2>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

Several important new language features have been 
added, including the SQL­92 case expression 
functions CASE, COALESCE and NULLIF. For syntax 
of these and other new language implementations, 
please refer to the Language Enhancements 
section in the Release Notes. 

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td width=20 height=22 valign=top>
<img src="./images/fb-tiny.gif">
          </td>
          <td valign=middle><h2>Universal Triggers</h2>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
Now you can write conditional insert / update / delete 
actions in one Before or After trigger to have the one 
trigger cover all DML actions for that trigger's phase. 
This cuts down the composition and maintenance of 
triggers without deprecating the ability to have 
multiple triggers per phase.

          <td valign=middle><h2>Database Aliases</h2>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table> 

In the new aliases.conf file you can specify server­ 
side aliases for your databases, so you don't have to 
store the full path to the database on the client side. 
You can connect from a client app with the new 
Server[/Port]:Alias syntax.

          <td valign=middle><h2>Varchar Trimming</h2>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>  
Varchars now cross the wire right­trimmed to 
actual length plus two bytes. 
NOTE: As it is the client that requests the server to 
trim varchars, the Firebird 1.5 client (fbclient.dll or 
libfbclient.so) will trim, even if connected to a pre­1.5 
server version. If you use an old client, you will not 
get trimming, even if you are connected to a 1.5 or 
later server.

          <td valign=middle><h2>Max. Number of Indexes</h2>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table> 

Now in both Release 1.0 and 1.5 the maximum 
number of indexes you can define for a table has been 
increased from 64 to 256.

          <td valign=middle><h2>Execute Statement</h2>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table> 

This PSQL extension takes a string which is a valid 
dynamic SQL statement and executes it as if it had 
been submitted to DSQL. Available in Triggers and 
Stored Procedures. 



      <table>
        <tr>
          <td width=20 height=22 valign=top>

          <td valign=middle><h2>New context variables</h2>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table> 

Among those are CURRENT_CONNECTION and 
CURRENT_TRANSACTION: Each of these integer 
context variables returns the system identifier of the 
active connection or the current transaction context, 
respectively. Available in DSQL and PSQL. 


      <table>
        <tr>
          <td width=20 height=22 valign=top>

          <td valign=middle><h2>Enh. Named Constraints</h2>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
Indexes that enforce named integrity constraints may 
now be named with user­defined identifiers. Warning: 
if you use this feature, your database will not be 
downgradable to v.1.0.x or InterBase®. 

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td width=20 height=22 valign=top>

          </td>
          <td valign=middle><h2>Transaction Savepoints</h2>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

New SQL99­compliant user Savepoints (a.k.a. nested 
transactions) provide a convenient method to handle 
business logic errors without needing to roll back the 
transaction. Available only in DSQL. 


      <table>
        <tr>
          <td width=20 height=22 valign=top>
<img src="./images/fb-tiny.gif">
          </td>
          <td valign=middle><h2>New Configuration File</h2>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

Several files have been renamed in this release. In 
most cases, the new names involve some variant of 
"firebird" or "fb", e.g. the old gds32.dll is now called 
fbclient.dll. One of them is the extended configuration 
file now named firebird.conf. Firebird 1.5 provides 
enhanced security settings and several tuning options 
available through settings in this file.
