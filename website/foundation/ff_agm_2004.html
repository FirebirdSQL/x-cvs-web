    <td colspan=2> 

<ul>
<li>Please reply promptly to the roll-call and SIGN YOUR NAME.  We must have a quorum of 20 voting members.  We currently have 42 paid-up voting members plus two with subscriptions two months or more overdue for renewal.  If you are one of those members or any voting member who has never paid a subscription, you are welcome to observe the meeting but you are not eligible to vote, to nominate anyone for office or to be nominated for office yourself. <p>
Non-voting members are encouraged respond to the roll-call.  Please do so if you wish to "speak" to the meeting.<p> 
<li>During the meeting it will be essential to keep to the Agenda and to stay "on topic" during discussion of proposals.  Each proposal will end with a ballot, during which voting members will be required to fill out a voting form.  Voting forms will arrive into a <b>separate list</b> and results will be tallied and reported on this page.<p>
<li>When discussion of proposals is needed, please keep your opinion brief and on-topic.  If you need to ask a question, try to ask it in one sentence. Do not wander off into side-issues and conjecture. AGM is not for "chit-chat".  You can do that on the list at other times.  And please, no "me-too" messages. <p>

<li>Any new proposal - whether arising  directly from a scheduled matter or new must be sent to the Secretary directly, before the call for matters of General Business (Item 9) and preferably before the AGM begins. DO NOT SEND ANY NEW PROPOSALS TO THE LIST.  (The Secretary will present them).<p>
<li>After the Election of Officers, there is time for limited raising of special requests for the new committee to consider at its first meeting in March.  If you want to raise such a topic, please plan it and make it brief.

    </td>
    <td colspan=2><b>SPECIAL RESOLUTIONS</b><p>

<ul>
<li>2004-SR-01 :: <b>Change name of foundation to "The Firebird Foundation" </b>
<p>

That rule 1.1 (Definitions: Name), which currently reads:
<blockquote>

  The name of the association shall be The FirebirdSQL Foundation
  (referred to in these rules as "the Association").
</blockquote>

shall be changed to:

<blockquote>
  The name of the association shall be The Firebird Foundation
  (referred to in these rules as "the Association").
</blockquote>

Proposer:  Geoff Worboys<br>
Seconder:  Mark O'Donohue
<br><br>
<u>Reasons</u>
<blockquote>

  The new name is the same as the Firebird product, giving us a stronger 
  position in case of branding issues. It's also shorter and clearer.
</blockquote>
<hr size=1>


<li>2004-SR-02 :: <b>Change membership rules to allow associate members in Committee.</b>
<p>
That rule 10.b.ii (under "The Committee: Management by Committee"),
which currently reads:
<blockquote>

  [ the Committee shall consist of: the Office Bearers (...) and, ]
<p>

  ii. at least three but no more than eleven other Members, each of
      whom shall be a Principal Member according to Rule 3.k hereto
      described at the time of calling for nominations and shall be
      elected at the Annual General Meeting of the Association.
</blockquote>

shall be changed to:
<blockquote>

  [ the Committee shall consist of: the Office Bearers (...) and, ]
<p>

  ii. at least three but no more than eleven other members, each of
      whom shall be a Member of the Association at the time of calling
      for nominations and shall be elected at the Annual General
      Meeting of the Association.
</blockquote>
Proposer:  Mark O'Donohue<br>
Seconder:  Paul Vinkenoog
<p>
<u>Reasons</u>
<blockquote>
Committee membership is not a privilege, but an extra contribution
made in the form of work. Allowing associate members on the Committee
gives these members an opportunity to make that extra contribution,
and may result in a more productive and/or skilled Committee because
of the bigger pool of potential nominees.
</blockquote>
<hr size=1>
</ul>

<b>ORDINARY RESOLUTIONS</b>
<ul>

<li>2004-OR-01 :: <b>Offer a number of Full and Associate memberships to active developers.</b>
<blockquote>

That the Committee, in accordance with Rules 3.k.ii and 3.q, offer a
number of honorary Full and/or Associate memberships to those who
contribute most to the code base. The number may be between 5 and 10
for each type of membership, but this is just an indication; the
ultimate decision as to which developers are offered an honorary
membership shall lie with the Committee.
</blockquote>

Proposer: Mark O'Donohue<br>
Seconder: Paul Vinkenoog
<p>

<u>Motivation</u>
<ol>
<li>Many developers live in countries where the full or even associate
   membership fee is simply not affordable; at the same time the value
   of the work they do for the project often far exceeds this sum,
   even when the grants some of them receive are taken into account.
<li>Getting a number of active developers on board will make the
   Foundation richer and more representative of the Firebird
   community as a whole.
</ol>
</ul>
