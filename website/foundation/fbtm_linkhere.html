&nbsp;How "Mozilla Firebird" Name Hurts Firebird&nbsp;
</span>

<dl>
<dt><font color=red><i>Is the Firebird project in real danger from the Mozilla browser's name change?</i></font>
<p>
<dd>
Undoubtedly.  We spent a lot of time and energy to establish Firebird(tm) as a distinct brand, recognised not just in the database and in the Open Source arenas but also in the Linux, Java, integrated and embedded markets. After nearly three years, we have achieved a strong (and improving) level of name recognition in all these markets.
<p>
One strong objection to association of our brand-name with Mozilla is the inference that it would draw, that our product is linked in some way to Mozilla and its commercial connections.  We have the legal right to pre-empt this.
<p>
Currently, there isn't any another important software product called Firebird in the world-wide market. Firebird(tm) is widely used and recognised in the same paradigm as Oracle(tm), without need of the qualifying tag, "database".
<p>

<dt><font color=red><i>Database &lt;&gt; Browser, so why is it important to avoid the name clash?</i></font>
<p>
<dd><ul type=circle>
<li>As long as Mozilla never incorporated any kind of database connectivity in the web browser and Firebird never developed any style of browser product, Mozilla's products  wouldn't clash with Firebird. Yet database browser clients are commonly deployed with Firebird applications and we know of developers who iconise such tools for their users as "Firebird Browser".  (What else?)  Considering the variety of plug-in technologies that will potentially attach to either product, or to both, branding confusion is inevitable if Firebird's name is entangled with Mozilla products.  
<p>
<li>Although databases dwell in a separate category of software "commodity", it is a category that has wide impact on the whole software environment, because almost all programs use a database of some kind.  Even browsers can have link databases, mail clients can have addresses and messages stored in database, and so on.  Intranet and Internet database applications that use a web browser client in an n-tier architecture are becoming almost more common than the traditional client/server model.  A cross-platform DBMS such as Firebird imposes an obvious need to ship ancillary modules, such as online help, in web-browser-readable format.  Hence, it is already impossible to claim that a web browser would never impinge on the commodity space of a DBMS, or vice versa. 
<p>
<li>It is impossible to presume that name confusion won't interfere with our interests with regard to integrated application development and deployment in the Open Source, Java, web and Linux playgrounds.  Mozilla has a vast established user base, market and press presence, and brand recognition far bigger that we have.  A "Firebird" moniker on a successful Mozilla release would overpower our own brand recognition very rapidly.
<p>
<li>Name confusion among desktop users would be unavoidable.
</ul>
<p>
In a nutshell, it is disingenuous to deny that databases and browsers share "commodity space."  Both are infrastructure or "enabling" technologies that others use to build on their solutions. 
<p>
<dt><font color=red><i>Branding confusion will break a vital information pipeline for Firebird users (developers) and customers using their products.</i></font>
<p>
<dd><ul type=circle>
<li>Firebird users have an unusually high dependence on archived documentation (mail/newsgroup archives, technical documentation in multiple languages hosted on sites around the world) for information on technical and implementation topics.  Attaching the "Firebird" moniker to another high-profile product will quickly damage or break the "information pipeline" afforded by Google, Altavista and other search engines.
<p> 
<li>Over more than two years, Firebird has become a serious element of business, more than just a database engine. It has a whole business segment of third-party products building around it, that depends on the distinctness of the Firebird brand - books, conference, web sites, applications, libraries, etc.  All refer to "Firebird", not "the Firebird database".
</li>

<b>Summary</b>
</font><p>
Our strenuous efforts to protect our mark are based on the well-founded fear that the overlap of our brand-name with that of an existing, high-profile product, whose target market interlocks closely with our own, would compromise our own dependence on our trademark severely.
<p>
We are dismayed that the Mozilla decision was made, implemented and announced with absolutely no reference to us.  We regard the subsequent trivialisation, provocation,  misrepresentation and denial of our objections in public forums by some Mozilla leaders and community supporters as unconstructive and contrary to the spirit of the Open Source movement. 
<p>
Our overwhelming preference is to negotiate with the Mozilla team and try to settle it peacefully, without further jeopardising the public image of open source or the Mozilla project. It should be clear to Mozilla that they are strongly obliged to choose a different name.  We are happily disposed to assist them with this.
