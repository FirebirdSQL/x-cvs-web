2004-07-04. Approve a grant of 100.00 Euros per calendar month for development and support of Firebird .NET drivers

Details:  Grant is to assist Carlos Guzmán Álvarez in his task of developing, maintaining, documenting and releasing the ADO .NET drivers and the Borland Data Provider for Firebird.  Grant should be for six months initially, to be paid in advance in two quarterly rests.  Carlos would be required to submit a quarterly status report to the committee.
<p>
<dt>
2004-07-05. Approve a grant USD$200.00 per calendar month for development and support of Firebird ODBC driver. 
<dd>
Details: Grant is assist Vladimir Tsvigun in task of developing, maintaining, documenting and releasing the ODBC driver for Firebird.  Grant should be for six months initially, to be paid in advance in two quarterly rests.  Valdimir would be required to submit a quarterly status report to the committee.
<p>
<dt>
2004-07-06. Approve the appointment of Dmitry Yemanov to work full-time on the Firebird core code. 
<dd>
Details: Currently, Dmitry's work on core code and release coordination responsibilities are assisted by a grant of USD $450 per calendar month.  It is proposed that the current funding allocation should continue indefinitely and that a further grant of USD $450 per calendar month shall be provided by additional sponsorship from Broadview Software, to be underwritten by IB Phoenix.  The additional funding would enable Dmitry to give up his day job and work full-time on Firebird.  The new arrangement should not preclude Dmitry from receiving additional grants for special tasks.
<p>
<dt>
2004-07-07. Funding for the merger of the Yaffil code with Firebird 1.5 code. 
<dd>
Details:  A proposal to make grant funding available to Oleg Loa to assist Dmitry Y. with merging the Yaffil code into the Firebird 1.5 codebase resulted in the offer of a grant to Oleg of USD $1500 for three months' work on the task.  The offer has been declined because Oleg can not make the time available. 
<dd>
Dmitry Yemanov has offered to take the task on himself, in consultation with Oleg Loa and Dmitry Kuzmenko.  It has been suggested that a grant of some smaller amount (currently unspecified) be set aside as a consultation fee for Oleg Loa and Dmitry Kuzmenko. 
<p>
<dt>
2004-07-08. Review the grant funding currently allocated for Pavel Cisar's work on the QA infrastructure.
<dd>
Details: In July 2003 the Committee voted in the commissioning of Pavel's QA project with an initial grant of USD$1500 for 200 hours or approximately 27 days' activity.  The work was expected to be completed by the end of September, by which time Pavel would be ready to give a clearer picture of timing, milestones, assistance required, and so on. 
<dd>
Fate intervened and when, at the end of the grant period, I asked Pavel if he was ready for us to put the project back on the table and review his requirements with a view to a further grant payment, Pavel explained that an unexpected holiday and involvement with his day job meant he hadn't yet used up the initial grant.  He promised to let me know when the money ran out. 
<dd>
There was no notification from Pavel and the next we heard of it (from Paul Beach) it was clear Pavel was rolling the project again and had more than exhausted the original grant. 
<dd>
After consultation between Paul and Pavel, we agreed to sustain Pavel's current work with an immediate grant of USD$1000, for approximately 18 days during June and July. (In fact, the payment should have been sent to Pavel at the beginning of June but he still has not received this grant, due to a bank error.)   
<dd>
We should expect an interim report and a prognosis from Pavel at some point during the predicted period, in order to establish the parameters of the project and its funding.
<p>
<dt>
2004-07-09. Review status of existing grants.
<dd>
Details:
<dd>  
Coordination and core coding:
Currently, Dmitry Y. receives $450 per month in grant funding, notionally to cover approximately 60 hours per month.  Note that this rate has incremented twice since the ongoing grant was established in September 2002. Dmitry's conditions are about to change:  see Item 2004-07-06, above.
<dd>
Core Coding and Security:  Alex Peshkoff receives $250 per month, $150 of which is for approx. 40 hours of core coding and $100 for approx. 30 hours working on security issues and enhancements. 
<dd>
Code scrutineering:  Claudio Valderrama receives $500 per month for approximately 33 hours' commitment monthly.  He received an ex gratia grant of $500 last September when his time was overwhelmed with CVS activity.  Additionally, for four months from December 2003 to March 2004 the foundation co-sponsored (with Broadview Software) a USD $8000 project for Claudio to clean up the Firebird 2 source code.  The Foundation contributed $2000 to this project.
<p>
<dt>
2004-07-10. Rotation of chairmanship for Committee meetings.
<dd>
Details: Chairing the meetings is a lot of work.  Perhaps we could rotate who runs the meeting, and have each committee member take a turn.
<p>
<dt>
2004-07-11. Web site issues. 
<dd>
Details:
<dd>
1. A web page for members to promote their services.
<dd>
2. Recent initiatives/suggestions by FF members (discounts and free software for members).
<dd>
3. "Success stories" - N. Dessena/L. Franzen - is it necessary to follow up on this, given that IBPhoenix now has its "Powered by Firebird" section?
<dd>
4. Moving community resources away from Sourceforge. Several suggestions have been made re. using resources other than those provided by Sourceforge, so that we eat our own dogfood and use Firebird as the back-end for hosting newsgroups, mail-lists, etc. We have had several volunteers who offered time to work on this.  Is this something we want to do?
<dd>
5. Is it time to create a Web Group, set clear targets for them and let them manage their time and efforts?  They can co-opt other people to help, if necessary. We should at least establish some recommendations so that work can be started on this sort of stuff. 
<p>
<dt>
2004-07-12. Changing name of the foundation.
<dd>
Details:  As follow-up to the AGM decision to change the name to "Firebird Foundation",  P. Vinkenoog undertook to investigate exactly which rules would be affected.
<p>
<dt>
2004-07-13. Allowing Associate members on Committee. 
<dd>
Details: 
This rule change has passed the AGM vote, so we should take steps to implement it. 
<p>
<dt>
2004-07-14. Apparently unclear or conflicting rules.
<dd> 
Details: During the AGM it seemed some people thought that some of our rules can be interpreted in more than one way or that some rules conflict with others.  Create a sub-committee that can spend time on this during the next few months, find all the points in the Rules that need clarification or adjustment, and report back.
<p>
<dt>
2004-07-15.  Formalising procedures for grant applications and reviews. 
<dd> 
Details: On the old committee, Geoff Worboys was tasked with reviewing his previous proposal and presenting it afresh for discussion.  Again, fate intervened.  Does somebody else want to take this one up?
<p>
<dt>
2004-07-16. Status re. the Registration of the Firebird trademark.
<p>
<dt>
2004-07-17. Any Other Business

Frank Ingermann,
Sean Leyne,
Phil Shrimpton
Thomas Steinmaurer,

<p>
The bi-monthly meeting of the Committee was convened in the FFMembers list to give the members a chance to observe how the meetings work.
<p>
Minutes of the previous meeting were tabled and accepted (0311-01) by silent consent. There were no Matters Arising.
<p>
Financial summary report for the period 2003.11.08 to 2004.01.16 was presented on behalf of the absent Treasurer. (0311-02)
<p>
The first draft of the latest newsletter was presented, pending the addition of the President's report. (0311-03)
<p>
<b>AGENDA ITEMS</b>
<p>
0401-05 - Registration of the Firebird trademark:   An application for the Firebird trademark has been filed with IP Australia and we received notification that it was received. (H. Borrie, M. O'Donohue)
<p>
0401-06 - Status of Brazilian members' subscription payments being processed through CFLP: Artur Anjos undertook to find out how the legal and bank issues were going.  It was pointed out that the Foundation accepts payments by cheque. 
<p>
0401-07 - The question of changing the name of the Foundation from "The FirebirdSQL Foundation" to "The Firebird Foundation" was discussed.  Since the change of name would affect the rules, it was determined to be an issue for resolution at the forthcoming AGM.  M. O'Donohue and G. Worboys announced their intention to present a suitable proposal to the AGM. 
<p>
0401-08 - The prevailing visual problems and static nature of the Firebird website came up for discussion again, without clear resolution.  A number of members expressed interest in assisting with maintenance of the website.  An urgent issue is to fix the CSS to work properly with Opera and perhaps other browsers.
<p>
0401-09 - The question of a formal procedure for grant proposals was raised and discussed again.  Geoff Worboys was asked to refresh his earlier draft procedure and present it again for the Committee to consider. 
<p>
0401-20 - It was generally agreed that there is an outstanding need to review current grants and to set review dates for all grants.  The question is to be re-raised at the next Committee meeting.
<p>
0401-10 - Frank Ingermann's Factsheet for Firebird 1.5 met with general approval.  It was agreed that it should be made available at the project website. (H. Borrie to make it happen).
<p>
0401-11 - Status of the 'Stop a running query' project for Firebird 2, for which DRB Systems had offered funding:  Dmitry presented the results of his technical survey for implementing it.  The general view was that the whole issue needed to be viewed in the context of probable architectural changes as a result of the Vulcan development.  Further discussion was deferred to the next committee meeting.
<p>
0401-12 - QA project:  Pavel Cisar had found a good candidate to be an assistant in the development of the new qmtest QA framework:  Aleksey Kishkin, who has the required experience with Python and access to testing platforms.  Aleksey had been approached for details of time he could commit to a funded project. 
<p>
Pavel commented that, because the field testing of Firebird 1.5 had been so extensive, the focus for the new testing framework ought to be later point releases, Firebird 2 and Vulcan.  
<p>
0401-16 - There was further discussion about raising a grant to assist people who needed to be involved with the merger of the Yaffil enhancements into a 1.x (?) release.  Alexander Nevsky undertook to meet with Oleg Loa (Yaffil developer) to discuss the possibilities.
<p>
0401-18 - Dmitry Kouzmenko had proposed having his graphic designer design some Foundation membership certificates.  There was some inconclusive discussion on the subject. Dmitry undertook to produce a prototype.
<p>
0401-19 - We are still waiting for news about Mozilla's rebranding of their browser.  They have everything ready and are waiting for a response from a company that has used the new name in the past.  It might take a month or longer to resolve.  Ann Harrison and Mark O'Donohue undertook to send a follow-up email message to the Mozilla committee.
<p>
<b>GENERAL BUSINESS (0311-04) </b>
<p>
1.  Translation of Firebird messages: Dimitrios Ioannidis suggested that someone should write a HOWTO document that people could use for translating the messages in msg.db. It was mentioned that Karsten Strobel had begun a project to write a graphical application interface for this task.  Karsten is to be contacted.  (In fact, Karsten is a member of the Foundation and probably saw the posting - Sec.)
2.  Several threads were raised on the subject of encouraging new members to join.  It was mooted that localised national branches could be set up.
<p>

0401-14 - Recent Firebird success stories were discussed and it was agreed by many that there would be benefit in starting a web-page on the Firebird site to publish them.  Lucas Franzen and Nando Dessena undertook to gather stories and produce a template.
<p>

0401-15 - There was discussion about clarifying what consititutes "sponsorship".  It was suggested, for example, that one-off donations should be displayed as sponsorship for only a limited time. 
<p>
0401-17 - Task assignment to committee and members was discussed.  Apparently there was concensus that tasks should be assigned to specific "owners", who could then form teams, committees, or whatever was required to allow the task to progress. 
<p>
0401-13 - Annual General Meeting (date to be announced early in February).
<ol>
<li>Nominations were called for the new committee.

<li>0401-13a The matter of allowing associate members to stand for executive positions was discussed.  Since the change would require an explicit change to the Foundation rules, Mark O'Donohue and Paul Vinkenoog undertook to prepare a proposal for presentation to the AGM.

<li>0401-13b AGM - The question of giving a number of full honorary memberships to active project developers was discussed in principle. It remained undetermined how many should be available or for how long they might last.  Mark O'Donohue undertook to present a proposal to the AGM if it was considered necessary to introduce a new class of membership.
</ol>

The meeting closed on approximately January 28.

<b>Minutes of a meeting of the Committee
of the FirebirdSQL Foundation 
convened 17 May 2004, at Fulda, Germany.</b>
</center 

Committee members present: 
<blockquote>
Paul Beach (President), 
Jason Wharton (Treasurer), 
Helen Borrie (Secretary), 
Nando Dessena, 
Lucas Franzen,
Frank Ingermann,
Sean Leyne,
Holger Klemt,

This was a special meeting convened to take advantage of the presence of most of the Committee and a large number of Foundation members at the conference. Chair: Paul Beach.
<p>
Previous Minutes and Finance Report were not presented. 
<p>
After inviting the members of the Committee to introduce themselves, the chairman opened the meeting to the floor (Foundation members and visitors) for questions. 
<p>
<dt>
Ann Harrison asked how the Committee decides who a) gets grants and b) gives grants and c) lines up a "prospect" for a grant. 
<dd>
Helen Borrie and Sean Leyne explained that, so far, it had been a matter of the Committee deciding that a particular task needed the commitment of a person for a number of hours a month, discussing possible candidates and then approaching the favoured candidate.  If the candidate was disposed to the idea of receiving grant funding in return for a commitment, that person would be asked to present a proposal in terms of work to be done, availability and an hourly rate.  After discussion of the parameters, grants would proceed or not as the result of a ballot.
<p>
<dt>
Paul Ruizendahl (Compiere Project) asked whether the Foundation had a budget or any plans for promotion and documentation projects. 
<dd>
Discussion ensued during which several views were expressed in favour of contacting other open source projects to set up technical relationships, etc.  Nickolay Samofatov suggested that contact should be made soon with the maintainers of each of the major Linux distros. 
<dd>
Holger Klemt mooted the idea of "tools giveaways" for Foundation members.  Paul Beach mentioned the term "guerrilla marketing" to describe how Firebird community members could pursue ways to make Firebird known "out there" as a serious open source alternative to Oracle, SQL Server, et al, through contacts, news articles, etc.
<dd>
Ann Harrison raised a suggestion that the project Admin and the Foundation could consider a Firebird certification programme for database developers.
<dd>
Lester Caine suggested contacting the Mozilla Project with a view to carrying through on a relationship suggested last year by a Mozilla committee member, Brendan Eich.
<p>
<dt>
The discussion wandered to Lester's support activities with the Firebird PHP users. 
<dd>It was proposed (F. Ingermann, H. Borrie) that Lester Caine be awarded an honorary Associate membership. The motion was carried unanimously.
<p>
<dt>
Nickolay Samofatov asked how IBPhoenix and the Foundation would resolve the conflict of interest between the commercial goals of the company and the charitable nature of the foundation, given that the General Manager of IBPhoenix was now the president of the Foundation. 
<dd>
Paul Beach replied that, considering IBP and the Foundation had mutual and common goals, it was hard to see any conflict of interest.  The rules of the Foundation prevented any individual or corporate member from taking control of anything or from "vote stacking".  The president's role on the committee was to preside;  it was the committee's role to decide. 
<p><dt>
Armando Halpern complained that the committee seemed to take too long to make decisions and get information to members. When asked "what decisions? what information? Armando cited documentation such as project roadmaps.
<dd>
Nando Dessena pointed out that items such as project roadmaps were not the responsibility of the Foundation, but of the Firebird Project.  Sean Leyne drew attention to the Foundation newsletters and information that the Firebird Project was already putting out, via the website and the mailing lists. 
<p>
<dt>
Nickolay Samofatov raised a question about the inconsistency for licensing of new code:  currently, project developers were expected to choose between the IPL, the IDPL, the "LGPL + exception clause", MPL and FreeBSD.  Nickolay thought that Firebird Admin should decide on one licence. 
<dd>
Artur Anjos said he thought the licensing decision should be a Foundation issue and that the Foundation should take legal advice on which licence would be most appropriate.  
<dd>
Paul Beach replied that the project's Admin group was currently undergoing a restructuring, in order to involve the most appropriate people in resolving project decisions such as licensing.  If the Admin team decided they needed to take legal advice, they could ask the Foundation to fund the costs:  that was the Foundation's role.  
<dd>
Mark O'Donohue agreed that the licensing issue was for the project to deal with, it was a key issue and it needed to be resolved.
<p>
The meeting closed when the "free" beer (donated by absent member Craig Leonardi) was finished. 
<blockquote>
The next day, Lucas Franzen ran an auction, in which 1313 Euros were raised for Foundation funds. Sean Leyne paid E375 for a pass to next year's conference; Frank Ingermann bought the original "Sparky" toy for E130; Martijn paid E22 for a packet of Bamsemums;  Gwan fared better and got another packet of Bamsemums for E16;  Andrea Armbruster paid E80 for a copy of "The Firebird Book";  Gwan bought IBExpert software for E300;  Johannes Rupprecht paid E160 for Log Manager software and E230 for IB Objects software.
<p>
Profits from sales of "Sparky" T-Shirts netted E54.27 for Foundation funds.
