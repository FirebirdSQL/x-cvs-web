This time, we are going to attempt to complete our meeting in reasonable time.
<ol>
<li><b>AGENDA ITEMS</b> &nbsp; If you have an item that you want discussed, please send it to the secretary (helebor at firebird-books dot net) <i>before the meeting is due to start</i>.  You do not have to formulate a motion for voting in order to present a proposal.  Simply decide on a title and provide brief details of the matter to be discussed and why you think it is important.
<p>
<li><b>VOTING</b> &nbsp; was the main source of problems last time.  Mark has undertaken to monitor the ffvote server this time.  However, if the server goes down when a matter needs to be put up for voting, we will deal with that matter by email.  The Chairman will decide whether a proposal should be posted to ffvote or by email.  Once that decision is announced, it is not to be changed arbitrarily by someone else, even if the voting server gets back into service before the email ballot finishes. <i>There is to be NO duplication of ballots.</i>
<p>
If you see an email with PLEASE VOTE in the subject, and it is *not* a notice to go and cast your vote at the web interface, you should REPLY ONLY ONCE with &quot;Aye&quot; (or &quot;Yes&quot;), &quot;No&quot; or &quot;Abstain&quot;.  If you vote No or Abstain, you may optionally add a comment.  Other than that, simply sign your name and add no further comment. 
<p>Do not vote on matters that do not ask you to vote. Do not reply to PLEASE VOTE notices that direct you to cast your vote at the ffvote web interface.
<p><font color=red>Do not reply to threads on voting forms.</font><p>
<li><b>PROPOSALS FOR BALLOT</b> &nbsp; You may post a new proposal into ffvote if the Chairman invites you to do so. If you want help with the wording, please email me (helebor at firebird-books dot net) with your version of the proposal and I will tidy it for you and send it back for you to post yourself. 
<p>The Chairman, Secretary and Vice-President (if he is not the Chairman) may post proposals on behalf of other people.  The rest of you, please post proposals only on your own behalf.
<p>
<li><b>PROMPTNESS</b> &nbsp; Proposals will go through several stages. At the point where the Chairman invites you to post your proposal, or directs me (Secretary) to do so, all discussion is complete.  When the motion is ready for voting, it will appear in the list with PLEASE VOTE in the subject. Cast your vote promptly (within 24 hours).  The Chairman or the Secretary will close the ballot after 24 hours or when there are 10 positive votes, whatever comes sooner. The person who closes the ballot, or who closes the discussion of a matter that does not go to a ballot, will report that the matter is closed.  Once a matter is closed, there will be no further discussion.  Please do not respond to late messages on any closed matter.  
<p>
<li><b>SUMMARIES</b> &nbsp; At the July/August meeting we decided by consent to make it the responsibility of the presenter of a matter, whether it goes to ballot or not, to summarise the matter and the discussion.  Please make a real effort to do this.  Make it a SUMMARY, not a blow-by-blow recapitulation of the discussion.  When you post the summary to the list, make SUMMARY the first word in the subject and follow it with the Agenda item number, e.g. 2004-10-99. Inside the summary, if the matter involved voting, cite the Motion number (ffvote Question number) if there is one.<p>
<table bgcolor="cornsilk" cellpadding=4 border=1>
  <tr><td>
If it is a struggle for you to manage the English, please ask the list for a volunteer to help you. 
  </td></tr></table>
</ol>

People, if you would really make a big effort to observe these controls, we can avoid the craziness of last time and get through our business promptly and, hopefully, in a way that keeps the meeting interesting for all of us.  Let's aim to be finished inside one week.
<br>
Helen Borrie, Secretary

<b>Minutes of a meeting of the Committee

convened 5 July 2004 in the FFMembers list.</b></center>

Philippe Makowski, 
Alexander Nevsky,

<p>

The meeting was opened by Paul Beach on July 5, 2004, Paul Beach presiding.

2004-07-01 Minutes of the Committee meetings from January (on-line) and May (at Fulda, Germany) were presented and both were accepted.
<p>
<b>Matters arising from the May Minutes </b>
<p>  
M. Tonies submitted a correction to the list of auction winners at Fulda: "Johannes Rupprecht paid E160 for Log Manager software..." add "and Database Workbench for Firebird."
<p>
P.Vinkenoog stated that the Fulda meeting was not a legal meeting because it did not conform to the rule that committee meetings be conducted by email. Discussion ensued in General Business as to whether it would be a good thing to include in a forthcoming Special General Meeting a proposal to enable live Committee meetings to be convened at the annual Firebird conference. 

P. Vinkenoog objected to the idea because it could never be assumed that all of the Committee would ever be able to attend the conferences.
<p>

2004-07-02 The financial summary report was presented on behalf of the Treasurer. The report was accepted and there were no matters arising. 
<p>
2004-07-03 Newsletter.  Nobody volunteered to take over Set's former responsibility for the Foundation newsletter but H. Borrie offered to act as "point" for collating content and P. Makowski and P. Vinkenoog agreed to assist.

The additional funding would be met by accepting a further sponsorship commitment from Broadview Software of $450/month, shortfall (if any) to be underwritten by IBPhoenix.

<p>

<p>
2004-07-12, Changing name of the foundation: P.Vinkenoog and P.Shrimpton undertook to investigate the changes required in the Rules document. Similarly for 2004-07-13, Allowing Associate members on Committee and 2004-07-14, Apparently unclear or conflicting rules.
<p>
P.Vinkenoog identified changes to the following Rules: 
<ul>
<li>Change "FirebirdSQL Foundation" to "Firebird Foundation" in:
<ul>
<li>The header
<li>Rule 1 (name)
<li>Rule 2 (objectives)
</ul>
<li>In Rule 2 (objectives) he recommended changing "The FirebirdSQL Foundation" to "the Association".
<p>
<li>Rule 3l (three el)
<p>
After:
<blockquote>
 ii/ An Associate Member may be coopted into a sub-committee and shall
    at the discretion of fellow members of that sub-committee become
    eligible to vote on matters of process within that sub-committee
    excepting any financial matter.
</blockquote>
add:
<blockquote>
iii/ An Associate Member may be elected or appointed as a non-voting
    member of the Committee.
</blockquote>

<li>Rule 10b (ten bee)
<p>
Change:
<blockquote>
  The Committee shall consist of:
<ol type=i>
<li>the Office Bearers of the Association; and,
<li>at least three but no more than eleven other Members, each of
     whom shall be a Principal Member according to Rule 3.k...
</ol>
</blockquote>
to:
<blockquote>
  The Committee shall consist of:
<ol type=i>
<li>the Office Bearers of the Association; and,
<li>at least three but no more than eleven other Members, each of
     whom shall be a Member of the Association according to Rule 3...
</ol></blockquote>

<li>Rule 10f (ten ef)
<p>
Change:
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
to:

  Association...
</blockquote>

<li>Rule 10g (ten gee)
<p>
Change:
<blockquote>
  Any casual vacancy occurring in the Committee (including Office
  Bearer) may be filled by a Principal Member...
</blockquote>
to:
<blockquote>
  Any casual vacancy occurring in the Committee (including Office
  Bearer) may be filled by a Member of the Association...
</blockquote>
<br>
** A matter arises from the change proposed above--Secretary

<li>I also found two other places where rules concerning associate members in committees have to be changed, but these are not covered by the "Associate Members in Committee" SR; they'll have to be picked up by the "unclear or conflicting rules" team.
</ul>

H.Borrie reported that government fees for the name change would be AUD 122 and for the rule changes AUD 33.  However, on consulting with the NSW Office of Associations re starting the process to register the name change, she was informed that none of the proposed changes, to the association name or to the Rules, was permitted currently.  Constitutional changes must be applied for within one month of the plenary decision. 
Therefore, a Special General Meeting would be required to re-authorise the decisions, or they should be deferred for re-authorisation at the next AGM.  
<p>
2004-07-15. Formalising procedures for grant applications and reviews. P.Shrimpton volunteered to take up G. Worboys' earlier proposal on this issue and freshen it up for discussion at the next meeting. 
<p> 
2004-07-16. Status re. the Registration of the Firebird trademark. H. Borrie reported that the Australian registration was now cleared and paid for.  There was discussion of how to proceed with registrations in other countries. It was agreed the matter of registration in the United States should proceed at the next meeting and that investigation of Madrid Protocol countries needed careful investigation, considering the expense and the relative benefits of registering in different countries. Ann Harrison is to be asked for a status report on applying for trademark registration in the United States.
<p>
2004-07-17. Other Business 
<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>The meeting discussed several ways to tighten procedures for meetings to keep things on track and close off matters promptly. 
<p>
2004-07-10 there was discussion around the idea of rotating chairmanship from meeting to meeting, a concept that appears to conflict with our rules (9.b). Subsequent discussion raised the idea of sharing some of the secretarial tasks, especially the task of summarising discussion topics during the course of meetings. 
<p>
<li>Mark O'Donohue re-raised his proposal to provide a "Commercial Support/Services" web page, linked from the main menu of the foundation subsite.  Members would request inclusion and would provide a small paragraph about the services/products they offer. The purpose would be to establish a place where people looking for Firebird-related skills could go to find people who have them. Mark though it would give members the opportunity to identify themselves as contacts, thus helping them to continue working in the Firebird area.
<p>
The proposal was discussed by several members, with opinion divided on the issue of prioritising according to the members' levels of financial contribution.  There was also disagreement about the need for or value of prescribing the layout rules for a web-page by committee resolution. A motion proposed by Mark was finally withdrawn for want of a seconder.
</ol>
The chairman closed the meeting at 10:25 a.m. GMT on August 12.
