<h4>ANN: The FirebirdSQL Foundation"</h4>
<br>We are very pleased to announce the formation of "The
FirebirdSQL Foundation", a non-profit association with the objectives of
supporting and advancing the development of the open source FirebirdSQL
relational database engine.<br>
<br>
Since the Firebird project's inception in July-2000, the possibility
of setting up a non-profit organisation for raising and channelling funds has been discussed.<br>
<br> In late June 2002, a number of us started to pursue this option
seriously.&nbsp; The legal formalities for setting up a non-profit
association have taken several months, a process that resulted in our
'steering group' establishing the aims and rules for the new Foundation.
&nbsp;During this time the steering group members have also pursued the
objectives of the Foundation on an informal basis.<br>
<br>
Progress so far has been good.&nbsp; The basis of the Foundation
involves raising funds from membership dues ($300USD per year) and
other activities, and directing them toward funding development.
&nbsp;With an initial group of some 15 people and advice from various
other members of the Firebird community, the FirebirdSQL Foundation has
over the last four months, been able to provide a grant, funding Dmitry
Yemanov to support his excellent work in the project, - and we have the
capacity to continue funding that grant for at least another year.<br>
<br> Recently the Foundation has accepted sponsorship offers from
IBPhoenix and Atkin &amp; Associates. &nbsp;This has raised our funding
level for the current year over 12,000USD enabling us to also&nbsp; grant
some funding to Alex Peshkov for some Fb 1.5 development tasks and to
Claudio Valderrama for the task of reviewing code changes.<br>
<br>Targeting&nbsp;Dmitry, Claudio and Alex as the initial recipients
of grants in no way diminishes our appreciation of the extraordinary
efforts of all others who participate in Firebird. &nbsp;We would like
to also emphasize that our grants do not compensate Dmitry, Claudio and
Alex at anywhere near the commercial rates they would normally command
and they too deserve our appreciation for their extraordinary efforts.
&nbsp;However we hope the grants will allow our grantees to devote time
to Firebird, and that all others involved in Firebird will get some
benefit from seeing our project proceed due to their work.<br>
<br>
The Foundation would like to expand its support to other Firebird
development activities that we consider need our attention.  As our
current priority we would like to raise enough additional funds,
through increased membership and sponsorship, to provide grants in the
following areas:<br>
<br>
1. Quality Assurance/Testing<br>
We would like to provide a grant to progress the development and
refinement of the automated test suites based on the original InterBase
TCS suite, and the new QMTest suite developed by Pavel Cisar. <br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
2. Security Audit &amp; Enhancements<br>
We would like to provide a grant to allow a person to participate in a
security audit of the Firebird codebase, and most importantly, to
enable that person to fix any issues raised during the audit.<br>
<br>
So if you or your company are users of Firebird and get some benefit
from the work done thus far, or if you are a potential user and our
work is likely to be of benefit in the future, please consider becoming
a FirebirdSQL Foundation member, or becoming a sponsor, or making a
donation, and help us to progress this important work.<br>
