<h2>Procedure for issuing and review of Grants</h2>
<small>G. Worboys, reviewed by Phil Shrimpton, 2 September 2004</small>
<p>
&quot;Grants&quot; are funds put forward to progress the development of specific projects.  Some projects 
are specifically ongoing, such as code review, others will have a specific end result (even if the 
duration is not immediately predictable).
<p>
The procedure outlined here is not in the Foundation rules, it is a guideline and not necessarily 
fixed.  It may have to be adapted and updated as circumstances dictate.
<p>
Authorisation of grant funds to developers provided by the committee must be undertaken 
seriously; it is the committee’s legal responsibility to see that the funds are spent according to the 
Foundation's objectives.

<h4>New Grants/Projects</h4>
<ul>
<li> Small projects (total cost less than US$1000) can be authorised without further stipulation 
(beyond the caution mentioned above).
<p>
<li> Larger or ongoing projects (cost greater than US$1000) must go through an initial grant and 
review phase.
<p>
The initial grant authorised must not exceed US$1000 and its initial duration should not 
exceed 2 months (whichever happens first).  The committee must review the progress of 
selected developer after this initial phase to verify that the work has been acceptable and that 
sufficient progress has been forthcoming.
<p>
If the project is not specifically an ongoing project the initial grant period should be used to try 
and determine the expected overall cost of the project and to generate a project plan (if this is 
not known in advance).  This information can be used in review to allow committee members 
to decide if the project is worthwhile pursuing further.
</ul>
<h4>Large and Ongoing Grants/Projects</h4>
<ul>
<li> All large and ongoing projects should be reviewed by the committee at least every six 
months <font color="red">/*.  More */ or more</font> often if there is reason for concern.  Authorisations given to continue a project 
should not exceed 6 months.
</ul>
<h4>Grantee Responsibilities</h4>
<p>
The following responsibilities are expected of grantees. Repeated failure of any <font color="red">/* of the */ grantee /* s */ to meet these </font>
responsibilities will lead to an early review of the grant in question.
<ul>
<li> To ensure work agreed in the grant offer is carried out to the best of the grantees abilities.
<blockquote>  
Whilst in general the committee will not review the work of a grantee, any comments <font color="red">by others </font> on the 
quality of work <font color="red">/* by others */ </font> will be considered seriously
</blockquote>
<p>
<li> To ensure <font color="red">any minimum</font> time agreed for grant is spent on the project.
<blockquote>  
The committee understands that 
most grantees have ‘day jobs’, and available time can vary dramatically from week to week, 
but at the end of each period <font color="red">/* the grantee is expected to have spend the majority of the time 
agreed on the project.*/ the grantee is expected to have devoted  at least the minimum number of hours to the project for which the grant payment was allocated or, otherwise, to inform the committee of any shortfall for which adjustment needs to be made.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<li> To report <font color="red">/* on a monthly basis */ to the committee a summary of </font>work done during <font color="red">/* month,*/ the period applicable to each grant payment instalment</font> and work expected 
to be done <font color="red"> during the /* following month */ ensuing instalment period.
<blockquote>
/* Whilst the majority of the committee have a technical 
background, this */ The</font> report need not be <font color="red"> /* of a technical nature*/ at a detailed technical level</font>.  A simple bullet point list <font color="red">outlining each task</font> would be 
adequate.
