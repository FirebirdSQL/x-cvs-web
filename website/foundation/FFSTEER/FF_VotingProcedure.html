   <b>PROCEDURE FOR RAISING QUESTIONS (PROPOSED):</b><br>
   <br>

<blockquote><font color="#ff0000">1) - Any list member can post to firebird@123.co.uk
a proposal for a formal   <br>
   question.  the subject line prefixed with a "Q?" to indicate a <br>
   proposed question. ie "Q? - do we accept Geoffs Super simple membership 
  <br>
   model".</font><br>
   </blockquote>
     
<blockquote>2) - At least two other people have to reply approving the question
   <br>
   before it is approved to put to the steering committee.<br>
     <br>
   3) If approved the originator then re-posts the question again giving
it    <br>
  a "<font color="#ff0000">PLEASE VOTE QXX</font>" prefix in the subject 
line ie: "PLEASE VOTE Q12 - do we accept Geoffs   <br>
   Super simple mebership model".<br>
     <br>
   4) Everyone the votes by replying to the question with their answer to 
  <br>
   that thread.<br>
     <br>
   5) I'll keep track of the results as I have been doing on a web page.<br>
   </blockquote>
   <br>
   <br>
   In paralled with steps 2/3 the following can happen:<br>
   <br>
     
<blockquote>6) - When a proposed question is posted, (in step 1) everyone 
 in the <br>
   group can also post suggestions for modifications to the original question.<br>
     <br>
   7) - The originator of the question is responsible for reviewing any <br>
   feedback and modifying the question. If the originator chooses to modify 
   <br>
   the question, then he  reposts the modified proposed question as
"PROPOSED  Q - <br>
      do we want one or two levels of membership".<br>
     <br>
     <br>
   8) The posing of a modified question requires re-approval (as per step 
  <br>
   2) before it is accepted.<br>

   <b>ROUGH GUIDES (I've been using):</b><br>
   <br>
     
<ul>
     <li><font color="#ff0000">In any vote we get on average 4 people who 
don't participate, or roughly 15 - 4 = 11 members participating.  So
we need to cope with making decisions where varying numbers of members particpate
in a vote.  </font></li>
   
</ul>
   
<ul>
    <li><font color="#ff0000">For a result to be valid, it must have been 
voted for by at least 1/3 of the members with voting rights (ie, 5 votes)
and to have received either 2/3 of the votes cast, or votes over 50% of the
membership with voting rights(ie, 8 over votes).</font></li>
 
</ul>
<blockquote><font color="#ff0000">This would mean 5/7 (five out of seven
votes), 6/8, 6/9, 7/10 or 8 votes if  more of us vote (as long as we remain
15 members). <br>
  </font></blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><strike><font color="#ff0000">If at least two people agree that a vote
is particularly important, the rules for voting can be changed to apply to
the whole 15 members.  ie to pass a vote must have at least 8 votes
(ie over 50% of 15), and at least  For a result to be valid, it must
have been voted for by at least 6 votes (ie over 50% of 11), and at least
12 members must have participated  in the voting (ie &gt; 3/4 of the 15).</font></strike></li>

<ul>
    <li>Im only posting questions with boolean type answers (ie Yes/No or 
A/B)  currently.</li>
     
</ul>
   <br>
   <br>
   <b>ISSUES TO BE CONSIDERED:</b><br>
   <br>
     
<ul>
     <li>Should we put a timeframe on time allowed to cast a vote - and what 
 timeframe (5days?).</li>
     
</ul>
     
<ul>
     <li>The threading is helpful for tallying up the answers so please try 
 and follow it.<br>
