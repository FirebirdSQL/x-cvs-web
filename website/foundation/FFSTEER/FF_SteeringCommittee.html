<h3>FirebirdSQL Foundation -  Steering Group
</h3>
as at 1-Nov-2002
<br><br>
    <b>What is it:<br>
</b>
<br>
Before the "FirebirdSQL Foundation" can be registered as an Association,
decisions have to be made as to the makup and structure of the organisation.
 Including who will become the first officers (president etc) and members
of the "committee" for the newly formed "FirebirdSQL Foundation" Association.
 <br>
<br>
The group of people responsible for this are the  "FirebirdSQL Foundation
Steering Group".   All of whom will become members in the Association
once it is formed.  <br>
<br>
As the precursor to the FF Association, the Steering Group  members
get to vote and make decisions as required until the "FirebirdSQL Foundation"
association is formed.  This will include accepting of a set of "rules
of association" and (as mentioned) who occupies executive officer positions
and membership of the first "committee" for the FF association"<br>
