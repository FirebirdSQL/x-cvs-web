<h3>FirebirdSQL Foundation -  Steering Group
</h3>
as at 21-Nov-2002
<br><br>
    <b>What is it?</b>
<br>
Before the "FirebirdSQL Foundation" could be registered as an Association,
decisions had to be made as to the make-up and structure of the organisation.  As we progressed, we formally elected the first officers  (president etc) and members
of the committee, ready for the incorporation of the newly formed FirebirdSQL Foundation when it was finally approved by the Department of Fair Trading, New South Wales, Australia.
<p>
The group of people responsible for this foundation work were the  FirebirdSQL Foundation
Steering Group (later &quot;Committee&quot;).   All were pledged to become members of the Association
once it was formed.  
<p>
As the precursor to the incorporation of the FF as an association, the Steering Group members proposed, discussed and voted on issues as required.  The set of rules (required by law) went through six drafts until the Rules and Objectives of the FirebirdSQL Foundation were eventually accepted.  
<p>
During the months of work-up, Mark O'Donohue developed a complex suite of software from scratch, for conducting committee and general meetings via email lists and for conducting secure ballots.  The Committee still has to write documentation for this software, to be added to our rules as an Appendix.
