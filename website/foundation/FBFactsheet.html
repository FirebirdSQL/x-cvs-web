Firebird 1.5 is a full-featured SQL database engine. It is powerful, yet lightweight, with minimal configuration and 
administration needs. It's easily scalable from single-user, single-database usage up to company-wide enterprise 
purposes. A single Firebird server can handle multiple independent databases, each with multiple client 
connections. And best of all: it's true <i>Open Source</i>, thus free of any license fees even for commercial use.</b>

<ul type=square>

<li><b>A.C.I.D. compliance</b>: The concept of &quot;Atomicity, 
Consistency, Isolation and Durability&quot; is what Firebird 
is built for. 
<p>
<li><b>MGA</b>: A special feature of Firebird is it's &quot;Multi-
Generational Architecture&quot;, that allows the engine to 
handle various versions of the same physical record at 
any time, so any transaction can have it's own version 
regardless of other concurrent transactions (&quot;readers 
don't block writers and writers don't block 
readers&quot;). This ensures OLTP as well as OLAP 
operation. 
<p>
<li><b>Stored Procedures</b>: Using Firebird's PSQL 
(Procedural SQL), one can easily create powerful 
Stored Procedures for processing data entirely on the 
server side. A special flavour are &quot;selectable Stored 
Procedures&quot; that can calculate data row by row in 
the server and can be used like a View or a "virtual 
table" from the client side, which is especially useful 
for reporting tasks. 
<p>
<li><b>Events</b>: Stored Procedures and Triggers can fire 
Events that can be monitored from a client on a 
configurable TCP/IP port for "active databases". 
<p>
<li><b>Generators</b>: The concept of Generators (a.k.a. 
Sequences) allows the easy implementation of 
"AutoInc" columns, but goes far beyond that. 
Generators are non-volatile Int64 counters that are 
independant of transactions and can be used in many 
ways. 
<p>
<li><b>Read-Only databases</b>: For distribution of 
databases on e.g. a CD-ROM. Esp. when used in 
combination with the Embedded version of the 
engine, this gives unbeatable ease of deployment. 
</ul>

<ul type=square>

<li><b>Full transaction control</b>: A single client 
application can have multiple, concurrent 
transactions. The various available isolation levels 
can be fully controlled by the client on a per- 
transaction basis. The Two-Phase-Commit protocol 
allows guaranteed consistency across databases. 
Optimistic locking is also supported as well as 
multiple Transaction Savepoints. 
<p>
<li><b>Online Backups</b>: There is no need to shut down a 
database to back it up. A backup process takes a 
snapshot of the state of the database at the moment 
it starts, so users can continue working while a backup 
runs, allowing 24x7 operation. 
<p>

<li><b>Triggers</b>: Each table can have many separate row- 
level triggers that fire Before or After Inserts, Updates 
or Deletes. Inside a trigger, the full wealth of PSQL can 
be used to apply default values, ensure data integrity, 
raise Exceptions etc. New in Firebird 1.5 are 
"universal triggers": Here you can have one single 
trigger to handle Inserts, Updates and/or Deletes in a 
table all at once. 
<p>
<li><b>External Functions</b>: User Defined Function 
libraries (UDFs) can be written in languages like C, 
C++ or Delphi and can easily be plugged in to the 
engine itself via DLLs / SOs, enabling you to extend 
the functionality of Firebird "inside" the server. 
<p>
<li><b>Declarative Cascading Referential Integrity</b>: 
Ensures consistency and validity of n-level deep 
parent-child relationships between tables. 
<p>

<li><b>Character Sets</b>: Firebird implements many 
international Character Sets including Unicode with a 
variety of collations.

Firebird has full SQL 92 Entry Level 1 Support and 
implements most of the SQL-99 standard, plus some 
very useful additions. This includes DML/DDL 
statements, FULL/LEFT/RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN syntax, 
UNION, DISTINCT clauses, subselects (IN, EXISTS), 
internal functions (AVG, SUM, MIN, MAX, COALESCE, 
CASE, ..), constraints (PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, 
FOREIGN KEY), as well as all common SQL data types. 
<p>
Firebird also implements Domain and Field level Check 
Constraints, Views, Exceptions, Roles and a fine- 
grained Grant management. See the Release Notes 
and the Firebird Reference Guide for more details.

Firebird runs on almost any hardware. Even "small" 
hardware can do the job, esp. when used with Linux. 
As with any RDBMS, there are the usual aspects that 
influence performance: the amount of physical RAM 
(as little as 16MB will do for a start); the speed of the 
storage subsystem (like RAID systems) etc. Of course, 
the recommended hardware depends on what you 
want to do with the database, e.g. how large will it 
become, how many concurrent users do you expect 
andsoforth. You can start off with a minimal 
configuration and then power up the server later on as 
the need arises.

        </tr>
      </table>
The most commonly used OS platforms for Firebird 
are Linux and Windows (incl. MS Terminal Servers and Citrix Mainframes). 
Other supported platforms are 
Mac OS X, Solaris and HP-UX. 
<p>
Migration from one 
platform to another is painless and possible at any 
time: just backup a database on one OS using the 
Transportable Format, then restore it on any other.

Firebird supports a number of connectivity methods, 
including: native Component Packages for C/C++ 
and Delphi, ODBC, JDBC (JayBird), PHP Driver, 
OLEDB driver, dbExpress, .Net data provider and 
finally through direct API calls using fbclient.dll/.so.

      </table>
Firebird allows really huge databases. Databases can 
span multiple files, the size of each file is OS- 
dependant. The theoretical limit is currently 64TB for 
a single-file database, so the practical limit is usually 
the operating / file system or available HD space.

There are three different versions of the engine, all 
interchangeable and each with its own strengths: 
<ul type=square>
<li>Classic Server (one instance per client connection; 
SMP/HT support)
<p> 
<li>SuperServer (all connections handled by one 
module; currently no SMP/HT support) 
<p>
<li>Embedded Version (the entire engine in a single 
DLL / SO (!) for single-user, single-database use) 
All versions use the same db file format, so you can 
switch between all of them any time you like. 
</ul>

Firebird is based on the source code of InterBase 6.0 
that was released as Open Source by Borland in 
August 2000. The story of InterBase goes back as 
far as 1984, so in total there are close to 20 years of 
relational database experience in the product.

Firebird by means of collecting funds and giving grants to developers to help evolve 
and continue the project.
