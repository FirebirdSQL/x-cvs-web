<li>make a <a href="#donation"> donation</a>, or </li>
<li> become a <a href=#sponsorship>sponsor</a> of the Firebird project </li>
</ul>
All monies raised from subscriptions, donations and sponsorships enter a funds pool for allocation as grants to developers already active in the <a href="//http://sourceforge.net/projects/firebird">Firebird Project</a>.  Grants are decided by the Committee of the FirebirdSQL Foundation.

      <td><font face="Verdana" size="-1">The list of sponsors currently funding Firebird work is <a href=index.php?id=sponsorship.html>here</a>.  By the time the Foundation received its Certificate of Association on November 20, 2002, it had already commenced putting sponsorship and subscription receipts out as grant funding.  This has enabled the following developers to allocate extra hours, beyond their already substantial voluntary time, to key works for current and forthcoming releases:
        <ul type=circle>
          <li>Dmitry Yemanov, who is coordinating and doing significant amounts of code work on Firebird 1.5 and 2.0
          <li>Claudio Valderrama, who has taken on the role of scrutinising the code that developers commit to the CVS tree
          <li>Alex Peshkoff, who is assisting Dmitry and others with coding and standardisation
        </ul>
	Additional sponsors are always welcome!  This is your opportunity to play your part towards a better and better Firebird.<p>
        We are especially interested next to look at supporting some of our developers currently working on the Testing Harness and on Security enhancements.
