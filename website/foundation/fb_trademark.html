&nbsp;The Firebird Name as our Trademark&nbsp;

<!-- CONTENT HERE -->
<i>Researched by Pavel Cisar and two of our legal consultants</i>
<ol type=1>
<li>Trademarks fall in the same category of commercial law as patents and copyright. The trademark law is basically the same in all countries, as trademarks, patents and copyright laws were consolidated by several international agreements. Although some minor procedural differences exist in some countries, the basics are the same everywhere.
<p>
A comparison of US, UK and Czech laws was easy to research.  The following paragraphs refer mostly to US law, but our legal researchers found no significant differences in other places.
<p>

<li>There are <i>Trademarks</i> and <i>Service marks</i>:
<ul>
<li>A trademark is a word, phrase, symbol or design, or a combination of words, phrases, symbols or designs, that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others. 
<li>A service mark is the same as a trademark, except that it identifies and distinguishes the source of a service rather than a product. The same basic rules apply to both "marks". 
</ul>
For our case, "Firebird" is a simple wording trademark attached to a <i>software product</i>. So our trademark is not in conflict with other similar but different trademarks like "Firebird BBS" or even Firebird from Pontiac.  (The latter is actually <i>registered</i> as "PONTIAC FIREBIRD", not as "FIREBIRD").  Notwithstanding that software is also in different class to automobiles, another usage of the Firebird mark would not clash with our own if we had used "Firebird SQL". As you will see later, it is irrelevant, since our mark is "Firebird", and we do legally OWN it.
<p>
There would not be a conflict if Mozilla were to use the actual trademark "Mozilla Firebird". The legal requirement in this case would be that they should not use "Firebird", and that they MUST remove all references to "Firebird(TM)" from their sites, products, publications, etc. They can use "Mozilla Firebird" or "whatever Firebird" if they wish, but we must (as you'll see later) require that they do not use "Firebird" as trademark for software package. The challenge to the use of "Firebird" applies, even for using "Firebird" as a codename, if they use the name in or with reference to products that are available to the public.
<p>
<a href=index.php?id=fbtm_linkhere.html>Link here</a> for the arguments as to why we need to require Mozilla to refrain from using the "Firebird mark". 
<p>

<li>A trademark can be owned by person or legal entity. 
<blockquote>
Ownership of the mark entails the right and liability to defend the mark.  The owner can be a person or a legally constituted entity.  To avoid "drawing a short straw" to choose a project member who would own the mark, the right to claim the ownership of the Firebird trademark is delegated to the FirebirdSQL Foundation (Inc.), which is so constituted under the law of the State of New South Wales, Australia.
</blockquote>

<li>Some constraints exist in law, determining what can be used as a trademark. There were some opinions that "Firebird" is a common word and can't be a trademark (the "common word or phrase" constraint is an explicit part of US law, not generalised to all international jurisdictions). "Windows", for example, is not a trademark. The operating system's trademark is actually "Microsoft Windows" exactly because of the common word constraint.
<blockquote>
Any claim that the word "Firebird" cannot be a trademark because of the "common word" constraint is false.  Firebird IS NOT a common word and has been registered as a trademark in the US, the UK and other countries many times before, including some registrations which are still active. Precedent dictates that the word "Firebird" is a valid trademark.
</blockquote>
<li>Exactly the same trademark can be in active use by multiple owners at the same time.
<p> Trademarks are primarily classified and identified by class number. For software, it is class No. 9. that covers "Scientific, nautical, surveying, electric, photographic, cinematographic, optical, weighing, measuring, signalling, checking (supervision), life-saving and teaching apparatus and instruments; apparatus for recording, transmission or reproduction of sound or images; magnetic data carriers, recording discs; automatic vending machines and mechanisms for coin operated apparatus; cash registers, calculating machines, data processing equipment and computers; fire extinguishing apparatus." Incidentally, "software" is not explicitly listed.
<ul>
<li>The list of trademark classes is part of the international legal treaty and is exactly the same in all countries. 
<li>The same trademark used in different classes do not collide.
<li>The same trademark can be used or registered in multiple classes.
<li>Use of a trademark in a class can be narrowed <i>by the owner</i> to just a subset of uses, described by class. 
<blockquote>
The description of usage area is required for <i>registration</i>.  However, when a trademark is claimed but not registered, the areas of usage are determined by the  owner's statement and must correspond to real usage and can be defended in court. So, we can claim "Firebird" for use for any software package and defend it in court, but not for other uses in class 9 that we really don't exercise (like optical or life-saving instruments . 
<p>
There is no evidence of legal grounds for Mozilla to claim that "Database&lt;&gt;Browser".  They have no grounds for proceeding to use our mark on the presumption or inference that the legal owner of the mark has no use of the mark that does not conflict with its use for their web browser.
</blockquote>
</ul>
We do already, in fact, use the "Firebird" mark very broadly for other software areas <i>directly related</i> to database server. Although the <i>name</i> "Firebird" refers to the the database engine and client modules, actual usage of our "Firebird" trademark applies to a much broader range of products. There are other packages related to database engine like drivers (Firebird .NET provider, ODBC driver), tools (Firebird configure manager etc.).  There is no indication that we would not include modules related to (web or database or whatever) browsing (Firebird Explorer or Browser, anyone?) that could be distributed as part of "Firebird" 
<p>
<i>Remember, trademarks cover products and services and it's up to us what we regard as "Firebird" product</i>.
<br>There is ample evidence that our use of the "Firebird" trademark applies to many other product components besides the server and client modules.  It can not be inferred that our mark is used for "just a database server". In court, we can defend the "Firebird" trademark for use in <i>any</i> software package category, including browsers. 
<p>
Unless deliberately narrowed by the owner, the whole area of software is easily defended for any software package. For example, Linus Torvalds would win any case against use of the sole word "Linux" as a brand for any software product, because it is his trademark. even though Linux is just a kernel.  Nobody would even try to challenge that.
<blockquote>
<i>We actually own many related trademarks, likethe  mentioned Firebird .NET Data Provider(tm), JayBird(tm) etc. If we had a product called "Firebird Browser", we would own the trademark for it.</i>
</blockquote>

So far, so good.  If the Mozilla crew used the words "Mozilla Firebird" as their trademark - as some of their people claim is their real intention - we don't own that and it might be argued that the qualifier "Mozilla" diffentiates the mark from our trademark sufficiently to eliminate confusion. If this gets down to a question of legality, we have clear grounds to dispute their use of "Firebird"(tm).
<p>

<li>If there are multiple entities using the same trademark in the same area, it is all up to the affected parties to resolve it. 
<ul>
<li>Each could agree to indemnify the other for use of the trademark, permitting both to use the mark without risk of being challenged by the other. Of course, if evidence exists of such a settlement between the parties, it will not be easy to seek a legal remedy later if one party changes its mind.  
<p>
A dispute might arise in this situation, where one party is displeased with the way the other party is using the mark and then they may seek a legal remedy. The resolution of entitlement to use the mark is based on the <i>date of first use in commerce</i>. It is not necessary to have the mark registered, or publicly claimed (usually by public use of (tm) mark).  It applies to the first date of <i>local</i> use in the given country. 
<p>
<li>International treaties allow any <i>speculative</i> trademark registrations to be challenged. <p> For example, someone who tried to register "Coca-Cola" in a country where it is has not been registered by Coca-Cola Corp would be very likely, although not certain, to lose his mark in court. Such cases are very rare and mostly resolved out of court.  For a software package distributed over Internet, the date of first use in a given country can be a very interesting intellectual exercise.  Research indicates that it is commonly resolved as date of publication on Internet, if citizens of the given country were able to reach the product.
<p>
<li>The validity of our claim to ownership of "Firebird" trademark could be challenged, and we can also challenge others' claims to ownership of "Firebird" mark. If claim of ownership goes unchallenged for some time, it is considered valid.  In fact, the trademark registration procedure contains a thirty day period of "publication for opposition" to give challengers the opportunity to present their own claims.  Challenges beyond that are still possible, although harder to argue.  Our public opposition to use of our "Firebird" trademark by Mozilla is definitely good for us from a legal point of view, even if it didn't win hearts for us in the forums. 
<p>
<li>The other side of the coin is that our own claim could be challenged as well. While it's not necessary to register a trademark to own it, it is regarded as a desirable safeguard to avoid any unnecessary disputes. Searching the trademark registry is a good practice before any claim of ownership is made. So, here are some facts about use of "Firebird" trademark for software:
<ul type=circle>

<li>No live "Firebird" registered trademark in the US is for software. 
<li>One live registration for software has been registered in the UK for Microprose since the 80's, that would expire in 2005. As it is 
confined to games, any claim by them for the mark would not collide with ours.
<li>The researcher could not find any software package older than our own that actively uses just a word "Firebird" as trademark (see paragraph 2, "Firebird BBS") <i>for commerce</i>.  A math/spelling game named "Firebird", for primary school children, is distributed by an Australian company:  we could not get any information about the original published date.
</ul>

As far as we can tell, we are sole entity right now that has been actively using the word "Firebird" in commerce as a  software package trademark between 2000 and today.
<p>

<li>Ownership of the trademark brings with it the exclusive right to use the trademark in any  geographical territory and usage area where is <i>actually</i> used. It is the owner's right to deliberately tolerate any violation of this exclusivity right, or to challenge it.  If a violation goes unchallenged, the party may, according to custom, lose its right to exclusivity in that disputed geographical territory and/or usage area.  It is not a <i>de jure</i>, however, that failure to defend a violation results in loss of the right. 
<p>

Ownership of trademark is merely a right to sue and win, nothing less and nothing more.  However, in any challenge and search for remedy, because the trademark owner has all the aces to win in court, he is thus in the best position to negotiate. 
<p>
The routine procedure in that case is: <ol type=i>
<li>As a first step, one can politely ask for remedy. 
<li>If that fails, the usual next step is to send lawyers after the violator to seek an out-of-court resolution and even to ask for compensation of damages
<li> The last step is in court.
</ul>

Trademark ownership thus means nothing if you are not prepared to send lawyers after any violator. It provides a legal framework for resolution in the event that the owner resorts to legal action, but nothing more.  In reality, it provides a mechanism to scare the violator into mending his ways; &nbsp;and to provide for monetary compensation for damages and costs.
<p>

<li>As you can see, we own the "Firebird" trademark for software packages and have an entity (the Foundation) that can <i>potentially</i> send lawyers after any violator. Mozilla's violation makes it a potential target for legal pursuit.  If AOL-Time-Warner provides underwriting to Mozilla for legal suits against it, then it would be a <i>very</i> good target from the point of view of recovering our prosecution cost.  Any distributor of their package would also become a target.  Their position is at best risky.  
<p>
It places us in good position to ask for immediate remedy and really get it. But if necessary, we must demonstrate our will to take it to the court, otherwise they may just ignore us. 
<p>
So far, presenting our objections to the Mozilla crew and others from an ethical point of view has had no effect.  We all abhor the idea of taking a fellow OS project to the courts but, if they continue to hold their position (that it's legal) then it would be more effective for us to play the game from the legal point of view.  We can show them that WE have all aces in hand and politely ask them for immediate remedy.
</ol>
