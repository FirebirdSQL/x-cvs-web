After months of discussion and further months of legal investigation, 
we're finally comfortable moving forward with new names. The new name 
for the Phoenix browser is "Firebird". The documentation and product 
strings will be updated soon. In addition to securing the Firebird name, 
we've also got the OK, from those contributing legal resources, to use 
the name "Thunderbird" for an email client. Hopefully this will be the 
end of naming legal issues for a while.

The original <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=12290#12290">link</a> to the Mozilla Phoenix name debate is also no longer avaliable, but was posted about mid Dec 2002.<br>
<br>
But a reference was posted quoting our website
http://firebird.sourceforge.net and a comment of the form "too bad I
liked the name". <br>

In his response, Asa, replies: "The chances of someone
confusing a web browser and a relational database are about as slim as
someone confusing a loaf of bread and a bananna." <br>
