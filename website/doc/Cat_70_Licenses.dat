# Category title (shown on web page):
Firebird Licenses

# Every manual or paper gets its own section below, formatted like this:
# - 1st line: Document title in English.
# - Following lines: The links to the different languages/formats. Each line
#   starts with the language code, followed by ":", followed by the document's URL.
#   You can optionally add a {type override} to the URL, in case the PHP script
#   doesn't determine it correctly. Example:
#     en:http://www.ibphoenix.com/main.nfs?a=ibphoenix&page=ibp_60_sqlref{html}
#
# One or more empty (or all-blanks) lines mark the end of the section for the
# current title. After that, either EOF or a following title is expected.
#
# Comment lines must have '#' as their first non-blank character. End-of-line
# comments are not supported.
