<H4>Introduction</H4>
We're collected various historic records about InterBase and Firebird from ancient   times to present days. To be consistent, we're arranged them in groups that cover significant periods in history of InterBase and Firebird, and link these groups in chronological order. Moreover, we're provided a small Who's Who gallery of InterBase/Firebird community.
<p>
Although our records are quite complete and accurate, it's possible that we're missed some interesting document or important event that you're aware of. Please, report any such omission to our <?php GetRabbitSafeEMailLink("helebor","historiographer",true) ?>.
<p>
Because some records are links to other sites, it's possible that these links would get broken over time. Please, report any such broken link to our <?php GetRabbitSafeEMailLink("pcisar","webmaster",true) ?>.
