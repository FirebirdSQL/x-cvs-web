<H4>How InterBase became Open Source</H4>

<b>From article featured in the UK Borland Users Group Magazine<br> (Nov/Dec 2000)
</b><p>
"Just before Christmas 1999 Dale Fuller's management team had a meeting with the senior executives of the InterBase division and told them of their new business plan. It has been stated by informed personnel that they had decided that the revenue stream was insufficient for the size of the division. They also said they wanted to lay off at least 50% of the current InterBase staff of 39 (including part-timers and contractors ). In addition, there would be no budget to restore the struggling US marketing and sales staff, which had already been reduced to one 3/4 time person and an intern. This was not a workable scenario to grow a product business. It has never been clear to me just what Dale and his team had in mind, but I believe it was intended to cancel the release of 6.0 and sit on the diminishing revenue stream from 5.n for a couple of years."<p>

"Possibly unbeknown to the Inprise management team, the InterBase team had been quietly building a sound and profitable (i.e., not loss making) business. One of the original developers of InterBase (Ann Harrison) had continued to provide excellent technical support for the product via the mers list server/news group. The product manager, Bill Karwin had equally spent many hours there helping developers. On the business side Paul Beach, responsible for worldwide sales (non-US) was basically generating about 90% of the total turnover. With little resources he had concentrated on building a formidable network of VARS that typically integrated InterBase with other Borland tools."<p>

"Their response (Karwin and Beach) to the new business plan was probably not what was expected. They resigned. Their resignations hit developers and VARS hard. Contractually they couldn't explain why they resigned, but gradually the above picture became clear. Thus the InterBase Developer's Initiative (IBDI) was born. Suddenly we discovered that some serious business and serious money was riding on InterBase. Enough people came forward to buy InterBase several times over. A sale was not to be, but the development community was now forming itself into an organised force to be recognised."<p>

InterBase became an open source product on 25th July 2000. There should have been dancing in the streets and unbounded joy throughout heaven and earth. The release should have brought praise for enlightened and forward thinking management. Instead there was anger and recrimination towards Inprise (now Borland Software Corp.). What went wrong? <p>
Let's the events speak for themselves ! A list of events in chronological order as they have been recorded by on-line press.
