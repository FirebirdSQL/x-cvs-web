<H4>How InterBase came to be</H4>
Who could be more competent to delineate early days of InterBase than her parents ? Fortunately, Jim Starkey and Ann Harrison were willing to share their memories about those glorious days, when IBM ruled the IT world, Microsoft was a small company and true programmers didn't use Pascal.

<H5>Ann Harrison's Reminiscences on InterBase's Beginnings</H5>
InterBase started in the shower. Specifically in the blue-tiled walk-in shower at 297 Reedy Meadow Road, Groton, Massachusetts, USA. There, looking through the shower window into the woods, Jim Starkey had the "Eureka" that eventually became InterBase.

<h5>How Jim Starkey remembers it</h5>
I founded the company the day after Labor Day weekend in 1984. I had been at DEC for almost 10 years, had loved it, but didn't love it that much. I decided that if I were doomed to suffer, I would rather suffer from my own mistakes than somebody else's.

<h5>Further recollections from Ann Harrison</h5>
InterBase started on Apollo Domain, a spectacularly wonderful workstation with terrific networking. The initial release supported Apollo, Sun, HP/UX, VAX/VMS, Ultrix, and something else that escapes me. So, if you wonder 'was InterBase originally a Windows/DOS system?', the answer is 'no'.
