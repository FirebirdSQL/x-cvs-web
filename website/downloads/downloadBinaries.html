<p><b>Choice of download category</b><br>
The following different type Firebird server downloads are available:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>Stable Build</b><br>
A build that has been successfully run through the complete tcs test suite
and has proved to be stable in operation environments.<br>
<br>
<b>Milestones</b><br>
A build that has a number of new features or bug fixes has proved to be stable
but has not necessarily been passed through the TCS test suite or been used
in an operational environment.<br>
<br>
<b>Nightly Build</b><br>
Nightly the latest source is checked out and the install packages rebuilt.
This provides the latest up to date bug fixes/features but should only
be used for experimentation since no testing has been performed.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Choice of server architecture</b><br>
FirebirdSQL server comes in two models the classic architecture and a super
architecture. If you are new to FirebirdSQL then for Windows download
the super server (it is the only one available for win32) otherwise if you
are from a unix style platform start with the classic architecture which
is a little easier to experiment with and to learn the basics. Then
once you know a little more you will be able to determine which architecture
is best for&nbsp; your installation. From a functional point of view
both are equivalent and they are interchangable.
<blockquote>
<p><b>Classic</b><br>
The classic architecture allows for programs to directly open the database
file, It is architected to allow the same database to be opened by several
programs at once. The classic engine also allows remote connections
to local databases by providing an inetd or xinetd service (This spawns a
seperate task per user connection).</p>
<p><b>Super</b><b><br>
</b>The super server architecture provides a server process and client
process cannot directly open the database file and all SQL requests are done
via the server using a socket. The super server makes use of lightweight
theads to process the requests.<br>
