<b><font color="red">14-April-2003</font> Mozilla Takes Firebird's Name for its Browser</b>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> subproject formally known as <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/phoenix/">"Phoenix"</a> has decided to <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3075">rename its lightweight browser product to "Firebird"</a>. The Firebird development team, and the larger Firebird community, <b>strongly oppose</b> this change. 

<p>
We of the Firebird project are proud of our product and devoted to our branding.  Our marks are not there for the taking and our advice is that the law is on our side:  we have nearly three years of widespread international use of our mark.  
<p>
Legal issues notwithstanding, we take this as a slap in the face to the entire open source community. The easy route will be for Mozilla to quickly retract what it has done and pay the open source community the courtesy of an apology.  The hard route, which we sincerely hope to avoid, will be Mozilla proceeding with this, losing its Open Source cred and goodwill and taking the risk of making its product untouchable by the distributors.
<p>
We are dismayed that Firebird was not contacted before Mozilla's decision was finalized. This breach of principle has occurred in the heartland of open source, where we are all supposed to be above such things.  The attitude adopted by Mozilla's vocal proponents of the change, in essence "if they don't like it they can sue", is contrary to the generally accepted core values of the open source community.  It reflects poorly on a community that voices strong opinions when corporate entities employ similar tactics.  If Open Source is to win, we can do without brother cynically stealing from brother.
<p>  
Please make your feelings on this issue known by emailing and posting to the <a href="http://www.yahoogroups.com/community/Firebird-general"> Firebird-general list</a>.
<p>
Firebird thanks you for your support.

<p>
The development of Firebird 1.5 release reached it's final development stage ! The Release Candidate  means that we're "almost there", and we turned our focus to remaining known issues and rough edges, final testing and bug squashing. We made a lot of progress with it thanks to your feedback.

The first Release Candidate is out, and we are eager to hear about your experience (good or bad) with it. Please send your reports to the <?php GetMailingListPageLink("fb-devel","",true) ?> mailing list (or newsgroup). Don't forget that your feedback will help us to move forward faster!
<p>
<i>Background information:</i><br>
The 1.5 release is the first version based on new, cleaned and improved C++ source code tree with many new features and bugs fixed. Complete list of major changes beyond the 1.0 version is quite long, and you can read the <b>up-to-date</b> version <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/firebird/firebird2/doc/WhatsNew?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">here</a>.
<p>
<b>Although this release is very stable, is still not considered as final and "stable" by core developers!</b>
