<hr size=2><b><font color="red">26-April-2003</font>&nbsp; Protecting the Firebird Brand: Update</b></font>
<p>
After nearly two weeks of effort to get our objections heard via the Web and private email, we are beginning to see some action by the Mozilla leaders to unroll the re-branding of its lightweight browser as "Firebird&trade;".  When this issue first blew up, we took <a href="http://firebirdsql.org/ff/foundation/index.php?id=fb_trademark.html">legal advice</a>. On Friday (April 25), we (Firebird Admins), the FirebirdSQL Foundation committee and the IBPhoenix principals wrote a formal letter to the Mozilla admins, stating the legal position and asking them to contact us.  We look forward to their response.
<p>
However, over the weekend and today, we note 
<ul type=circle>
<li>a <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/roadmap/branding.html">branding policy statement</a>  that should leave nobody with an excuse to err
<br> and 
<li>some observable activity to change or disable web pages containing trademark infringements against our Firebird brand.
</ul>
<p>
The branding statement does a lot of footwork to make and reiterate the point that the product must be referred to as "Mozilla Firebird browser" and, preferably, as "Mozilla browser".  It's not a "back-down" on the choice to take Firebird's brand-name.  Still, now, provided all of the satellite websites comply AND "Firebird" disappears from all of their pages, documents and tags next month, as promised, then we can take comfort that the letter of the law, at least, is to be observed.
<p>
We wish that it had never become a question of confronting Mozilla.  As a proposal, the name-change from "Phoenix" to "Firebird&trade;" should never have gotten past the ethical questions raised in their forums and committees last December about taking another Open Source project's name.
<p>
We appreciate the attempts by Debian project admin Jonathan Walther, to try to mediate between us and the Mozilla folk.  We look forward to some kind of contact from Mozilla's leaders soon.  We still have quite a lot to discuss with them. We trust that Mozilla will continue to do what is required to proactively cleanse the Web and their browser project of the brandname abuses, including the &trade; claim on our Firebird mark.  
<p>
Firebird users who would like to help Mozilla in this task can do so by posting any infringements you find to OUR <a href="http://www.yahoogroups.com/community/Firebird-general">Firebird-General list</a>.

<b><font color="red">28-April-2003</font> How events unfolded in the "name" debate.</b><br>
<br>In case you've been away, and are wondering what has happened over
the last two weeks.&nbsp; Here is a quick recap over recent events as
they unfolded.<br>
<br>
On 14th April, the general public (and the <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org">Firebird project</a>) become aware of Mozilla's decision&nbsp;&nbsp; to rename their Phoenix Browser product to "Firebird" from a <font color="#000000"><a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/04/15/0137251&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=154" title="">slashdot posting</a></font>. &nbsp;&nbsp; They quote an announcement by Asa Dotzler in a <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3075">posting on mozillazine.org</a>.&nbsp; A bit more looking then finds the change well underway, mozillazine already have public discussion <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/forums/">forumns</a>&nbsp;
up (currently closed due to bandwidth problem),&nbsp; Asa opens their
firebird-general forumn with the first post, (including a comment that
they have <a href="Firebird_NameDebate_References.html#StartFirebirdForumn">secured the "Firebird" name</a>).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Apparently the name change discussion has been going on for months&nbsp; in <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/forums/">mozillazine.org forumns</a>, and mozilla.org were <a href="Firebird_NameDebate_References.html#NameDiscussion">aware we existed</a> when making the choice<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>.<br>
<br>
Fairly quickly, some Firebird people (including Admins) contacted Asa privately but <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=61212&amp;cid=5762702">didn't get much of a response</a>&nbsp; <a href="http://www.linuxworld.com.au/index.php?id=1031068403">(here</a> and <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/asa/archives/003055.html">here)</a>.&nbsp; An email advocacy campaign was requested, first by <a href="http://www.ibphoenix.com/main.nfs?a=ibphoenix&amp;page=ibp_Mozilla0">IBPhoenix</a>, and then supported by the Firebird Admins (<a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org">above</a>).&nbsp; The campaign asked to target Mozilla decision makers with a polite email, and to participate in the discussion at <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/forums/">mozillazine.org</a> explaining the problems their decision will cause us (<a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1032-997089.html">news.com article</a>).&nbsp; Some (most?) Mozilla users <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3075&amp;message=91#91">support</a> the name change (and <a href="http://www.bengoodger.com/software/mb/faq.shtml">here</a>).<br>
<br>
But the campaign apparently goes <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/dave/archives/2003_04.html#003073">astray</a>, (and <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=61212&amp;threshold=0&amp;commentsort=0&amp;tid=154&amp;mode=thread&amp;cid=5759494">here</a>) mozillazine.org <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3082">reports the protest</a>.&nbsp; The protest then gets interpreted as a request for a "spam" and "mailbomb"
attack by some Mozilla enthusiasts (for example <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3082&amp;message=6#6">here</a><a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=61212&amp;threshold=0&amp;commentsort=0&amp;tid=154&amp;mode=thread&amp;cid=5759494"></a> and <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=61212&amp;threshold=0&amp;commentsort=0&amp;tid=154&amp;mode=thread&amp;cid=5759494">here</a>).&nbsp; In response to the problem,
IBPhoenix, updates their <a href="http://www.ibphoenix.com/main.nfs?a=ibphoenix&amp;page=ibp_Mozilla0">protest page</a>
to remove most direct links to Mozilla decision makers and calls for
calm. &nbsp; The Firebird project also removes all links to Mozilla
pages with addresses on them (<a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org">above</a>), It's all reported on <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3086">mozillazine.org</a>. (17th April) and the issue gets picked up by slashdot.org, as they try to calm the situation <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/04/18/0344251&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=154">down</a> (18th April).<br>
Brendan Eich (from Mozilla) puts Mozilla's case in discussion on <a href="news://news.atkin.com:119/b7pisp+qva9@eGroups.com">firebird-general</a>.<br>
<br>
 On 20th April, the FirebirdSQL Foundation gets some legal <a href="http://firebirdsql.org/ff/foundation/index.php?id=fb_trademark.html">advice</a>, and doubts (<a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=62077&amp;threshold=0&amp;commentsort=0&amp;tid=154&amp;mode=thread&amp;cid=5814463">here</a> and <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3097&amp;message=3#3">here</a>) start to emerge over Mozilla's claimed to "securing" the 'Firebird' name.&nbsp; Ann Harrison (a Firebird Admin) is also <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/articles/article3097.html">interviewed</a> on mozillaine.org (21st April) (reader discussion <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3097">here</a>, including some comments by Jim Starkey on <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3097&amp;message=103#103">trademark</a>).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Slashdot again try to calm the&nbsp; situation <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/04/22/153205&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=154">down</a> (22 April).<br>
<br>
On the 24th April, an <a href="http://reactor-core.org/mozilla-position-on-firebird.html">interview</a> with an anonymous Mozilla devloper, and <font face="georgia, times, times new roman, serif">Jonathan Walther of the <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> project offers to <a href="http://www.ibphoenix.com/main.nfs?a=ibphoenix&amp;page=ibp_mozilla_jw">mediate</a> the name dispute (discussion at <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3111">mozillazine.org</a>).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
On the 25th April, Ann sends an<a href="http://www.ibphoenix.com/main.nfs?a=ibphoenix&amp;page=ibp_Mozilla3"> apology</a> to Asa and staff for the unintended "mailbomb" (discussion on <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3115">mozillazine.org</a>, .<br>
<br>
Then o</font>n 26th April, Mozilla release a discussion of their<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/roadmap/branding.html"> branding strategy</a>, which is then discussed on <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3110">mozillazine.org</a>&nbsp;
and on <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/04/26/1258205&amp;mode=thread">slashdot.org</a>.&nbsp; It seems the new name is "Mozilla Firebird".&nbsp; In Mozilla staff meeting <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/articles/article3118.html">minutes</a>
on the same day, to topic is refferred to as "The Browser formally known
as Phoenix". (But you've got to wonder that if "Mozilla Firebird" is ok
then what was problem with the original name "Mozilla Phoenix").<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Side Issues:</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Was Mozillazine hacked by "Firebird database zealots"?.</span><br>
as reported by <a href="http://www.neowin.net/comments.php?category=main&amp;id=10403">neowin.net</a>.&nbsp; Certainly not as far as the Firebird Admins are aware, and mozillazine.org don't seem to believe so <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3095">either</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Mozillazine try and</span><a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3104" style="font-weight: bold;"> explain</a><span style="font-weight: bold;"> (and </span><a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3104&amp;message=4#4" style="font-weight: bold;">here</a><span style="font-weight: bold;">) some troubling</span><a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/poll_results.html?id=3078" style="font-weight: bold;"> poll results</a><span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span><br>
(Including a comment by <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3104&amp;message=14#14">Alexander <font face="georgia, times, times new roman, serif">V.Nevsky.)</font></a>&nbsp;
Were they fixed, as seems to be implied in the article?&nbsp; Again,
certainly not to our knowledge.&nbsp; But online polls are notorious
simple to trick, so it's quite possible.&nbsp; However  if the <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/poll_results.html?id=3078">results</a> are anything to go by, and it was a disgruntled firebird user, then they are obviously not very good at it.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The wally running arround calling people "terroists" owns up.</span><br>
