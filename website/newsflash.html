<b><font color="red">14-April-2003</font> Mozilla Takes Firebird's Name for its Browser</b>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> subproject formally known as <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/phoenix/">"Phoenix"</a> has decided to <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3075">rename its lightweight browser product to "Firebird"</a>. The Firebird development team, and the larger Firebird community, <b>strongly oppose</b> this change. 

</p><p> We of the Firebird project are proud of our product and devoted
to our branding.  Our marks are not there for the taking and our advice
is that the law is on our side:  we have nearly three years of
widespread international use of our mark. </p><p> Legal issues notwithstanding, we take this as a slap in the
face to the entire open source community. The easy route will be for
Mozilla to quickly retract what it has done and pay the open source
community the courtesy of an apology.  The hard route, which we
sincerely hope to avoid, will be Mozilla proceeding with this, losing
its Open Source cred and goodwill and taking the risk of making its
product untouchable by the distributors. </p><p> We are dismayed that Firebird was not contacted before
Mozilla's decision was finalized. This breach of principle has occurred
in the heartland of open source, where we are all supposed to be above
such things.  The attitude adopted by Mozilla's vocal proponents of the
change, in essence "if they don't like it they can sue", is contrary to
the generally accepted core values of the open source community.  It
reflects poorly on a community that voices strong opinions when
corporate entities employ similar tactics.  If Open Source is to win,
we can do without brother cynically stealing from brother. </p><p>  
Please make your feelings on this issue known by emailing and posting to the <a href="http://www.yahoogroups.com/community/Firebird-general"> Firebird-general list</a>.
</p><p>
Firebird thanks you for your support.

<b><font color="red">24-April-2003</font> How events unfolded in the "name" debate.</b><br>
<br>Just a quick recap over events as they unfolded.<br>
<br>
On 14th April, the general public become aware of Mozilla's decision&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#000000"></font> to rename their Phoenix Browser product as "Firebird" from a <font color="#000000"><a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/04/15/0137251&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=154" title="">slashdot posting</a></font>. &nbsp;&nbsp; Announced by Asa Dotzler in a <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3075">posting on mozillazine</a>.&nbsp; A bit more looking finds the change well underway, mozillazine already have public discussion <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/forums/">forumns</a>&nbsp; up,&nbsp; Asa opens their firebird-general forumn, (commenting that they have <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=9133">secured the "Firebird" name</a>).<br>
<br>
Apparently the name change discussion has been going on form months
(link) , and they were aware we existed when making the choice <span style="font-style: italic;">(need link to Asa bananas stmt)</span>.<br>
<br>
Fairly quickly, some Firebird people contacted Asa privately but <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=61212&amp;cid=5762702">didn't get much of a response</a> (and <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/asa/archives/003055.html">here)</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; So an email advocacy campaign was requested, first by <a href="http://www.ibphoenix.com/main.nfs?a=ibphoenix&amp;page=ibp_Mozilla0">IBPhoenix</a>, and then supported by the Firebird Admins (<a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org">above</a>).&nbsp; The campaign asked to target Mozilla decision makers with a polite email, and to participate in the discussion at <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/forums/">mozillazine.org</a> explaining the problems it will cause us.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
But the campaign apparently goes <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/dave/archives/2003_04.html#003073">astray</a>,&nbsp; mozillazine.org <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3082">reports the protest</a>,
which then gets interpreted as a request for a "spam" and "emailbomb"
attack by some Mozilla enthusiasts.&nbsp; In response to the problem,
IBPhoenix, updates their <a href="http://www.ibphoenix.com/main.nfs?a=ibphoenix&amp;page=ibp_Mozilla0">protest page</a> to remove most direct links to Mozilla decision makers and calls for calm. <a href="http://www.ibphoenix.com/main.nfs?a=ibphoenix&amp;page=ibp_Mozilla0"></a>&nbsp; The Firebird project also removes all links to Mozilla pages with addresses on them (<a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org">above</a>), It's all reported on <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3086">mozillazine.org</a>. (17th April) and again the issue gets picked up again by <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/04/18/0344251&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=154">slashdot</a> (18th April).<br>
<br>
 <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=61212&amp;cid=5758009">Mark</a>, makes a comment.<br>
<br>
Mozillazine goes down, where they hacked as <br>
<br>
A few recent articles in the unfolding debate. Ann Harrison has a <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/articles/article3097.html">chat</a> to mozillaine.org,&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<br>
Doubts start to be raised about the legal advice, for Mozilla's ownership and use of the "Firebird" name.<br>
<br>
Jim Starkey puts in his <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3097&amp;message=103#103">view</a>, in the resulting mozilline <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3097">discussion</a> and slashdot try to calm the&nbsp; situation <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/04/22/153205&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=154">down</a>.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Mozillazine try and<a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3104"> explain</a> some troubling<a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/poll_results.html?id=3078"> poll results</a> (were they fixed? - I've no idea).<br>
<br>
And finally Mozilla release a discussion of their<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/roadmap/branding.html"> branding strategy</a>, and discussed&nbsp; <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3110">here</a>&nbsp;
apparently the project is to be known as the "Mozilla Firebird
Browser".&nbsp; (But you've got to wonder, that if "Mozilla Firebird"
is ok to use for the project name, then what was wrong with the
original name "Mozilla Phoenix").<br>
