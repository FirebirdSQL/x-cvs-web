<b><font color="red">14-April-2003</font> Mozilla Takes Firebird's Name for its Browser</b>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> subproject formally known as <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/phoenix/">"Phoenix"</a> has decided to <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3075">rename its lightweight browser product to "Firebird"</a>. The Firebird development team, and the larger Firebird community, <b>strongly oppose</b> this change. 

</p><p> We of the Firebird project are proud of our product and devoted
to our branding.  Our marks are not there for the taking and our advice
is that the law is on our side:  we have nearly three years of
widespread international use of our mark. </p><p> Legal issues notwithstanding, we take this as a slap in the
face to the entire open source community. The easy route will be for
Mozilla to quickly retract what it has done and pay the open source
community the courtesy of an apology.  The hard route, which we
sincerely hope to avoid, will be Mozilla proceeding with this, losing
its Open Source cred and goodwill and taking the risk of making its
product untouchable by the distributors. </p><p> We are dismayed that Firebird was not contacted before
Mozilla's decision was finalized. This breach of principle has occurred
in the heartland of open source, where we are all supposed to be above
such things.  The attitude adopted by Mozilla's vocal proponents of the
change, in essence "if they don't like it they can sue", is contrary to
the generally accepted core values of the open source community.  It
reflects poorly on a community that voices strong opinions when
corporate entities employ similar tactics.  If Open Source is to win,
we can do without brother cynically stealing from brother. </p><p>  
Please make your feelings on this issue known by emailing and posting to the <a href="http://www.yahoogroups.com/community/Firebird-general"> Firebird-general list</a>.
</p><p>
Firebird thanks you for your support.
