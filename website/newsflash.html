<hr size=2><b><font color="red">26-April-2003</font>&nbsp; Protecting the Firebird Brand: Update</b></font>
<p>
After nearly two weeks of effort to get our objections heard via the Web and private email, we are beginning to see some action by the Mozilla leaders to unroll the re-branding of its lightweight browser as "Firebird&trade;".  When this issue first blew up, we took <a href="http://firebirdsql.org/ff/foundation/index.php?id=fb_trademark.html">legal advice</a>. On Friday (April 25), we (Firebird Admins), the FirebirdSQL Foundation committee and the IBPhoenix principals wrote a formal letter to the Mozilla admins, stating the legal position and asking them to contact us.  We look forward to their response.
<p>
However, over the weekend and today, we note 
<ul type=circle>
<li>a <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/roadmap/branding.html">branding policy statement</a>  that should leave nobody with an excuse to err
<br> and 
<li>some observable activity to change or disable web pages containing trademark infringements against our Firebird brand.
</ul>
<p>
The branding statement does a lot of footwork to make and reiterate the point that the product must be referred to as "Mozilla Firebird browser" and, preferably, as "Mozilla browser".  It's not a "back-down" on the choice to take Firebird's brand-name.  Still, now, provided all of the satellite websites comply AND "Firebird" disappears from all of their pages, documents and tags next month, as promised, then we can take comfort that the letter of the law, at least, is to be observed.
<p>
We wish that it had never become a question of confronting Mozilla.  As a proposal, the name-change from "Phoenix" to "Firebird&trade;" should never have gotten past the ethical questions raised in their forums and committees last December about taking another Open Source project's name.
<p>
We appreciate the attempts by Debian project admin Jonathan Walther, to try to mediate between us and the Mozilla folk.  We look forward to some kind of contact from Mozilla's leaders soon.  We still have quite a lot to discuss with them. We trust that Mozilla will continue to do what is required to proactively cleanse the Web and their browser project of the brandname abuses, including the &trade; claim on our Firebird mark.  
<p>
Firebird users who would like to help Mozilla in this task can do so by posting any infringements you find to OUR <a href="http://www.yahoogroups.com/community/Firebird-general">Firebird-General list</a>.

<hr size=2><b><font color="red">14-April-2003</font> Mozilla Takes Firebird's Name for its Browser</b><p>The <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> subproject formerly known as <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/phoenix/">"Phoenix"</a> has decided to <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3075">rename its lightweight browser product to "Firebird"</a>. The Firebird development team, and the larger Firebird community, <b>strongly oppose</b> this change. <p>We of the Firebird project are proud of our product and devoted to our branding.  Our marks are not there for the taking and our advice is that the law is on our side:  we have nearly three years of widespread international use of our mark.  <p>Legal issues notwithstanding, we take this as a slap in the face to the entire open source community. The easy route will be for Mozilla to quickly retract what it has done and pay the open source community the courtesy of an apology.  The hard route, which we sincerely hope to avoid, will be Mozilla proceeding with this, losing its Open Source cred and goodwill and taking the risk of making its product untouchable by the distributors.<p>We are dismayed that Firebird was not contacted before Mozilla's decision was finalized. This breach of principle has occurred in the heartland of open source, where we are all supposed to be above such things.  The attitude adopted by Mozilla's vocal proponents of the change, in essence "if they don't like it they can sue", is contrary to the generally accepted core values of the open source community.  It reflects poorly on a community that voices strong opinions when corporate entities employ similar tactics.  If Open Source is to win, we can do without brother cynically stealing from brother.<p>  Please make your feelings on this issue known by emailing and posting to the <a href="http://www.yahoogroups.com/community/Firebird-general"> Firebird-general list</a>.<p>Firebird thanks you for your support.<p><u>The Firebird Admins</u><br><blockquote>John Bellardo, Helen Borrie, Pavel Cisar, Ann Harrison, David Jencks, Sean Leyne,  Mark O'Donohue, Dmitry Yemanov</blockquote><p><hr size=2><b><font color="red">14-April-2003</font> Firebird 1.5 Release Candidate 1</b><p>The development of Firebird 1.5 release reached it's final development stage !
